# ADR-0004: Hybrid JSON + Markdown architecture

**Date:** 2026-02
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

The dashboard needs structured data (meeting times, action priorities, email classifications). Markdown is great for humans but fragile to parse programmatically — regex-based extraction breaks on formatting variations.

## Decision

JSON for machine consumption, markdown for humans. `_today/data/` contains JSON files (schedule.json, actions.json, emails.json, etc.) generated by Phase 3 Python scripts. Markdown files in `_today/` remain the human-readable view.

## Consequences

- Eliminates fragile regex parsing from the Rust backend
- Frontend loads validated JSON directly — fast, predictable
- Two representations of the same data must stay in sync (Python Phase 3 is the synchronization point)
- Alternatives rejected: Markdown-only (fragile parsing), JSON-only (not human-readable)
