# ADR-0010: Focus, Week, Emails removed from sidebar

**Date:** 2026-02
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

The sidebar had 6+ items. Focus is a dashboard section. Emails are on the dashboard. Week is post-MVP. Too many nav items creates confusion about where to look.

## Decision

Sidebar has 3-4 items max. Focus, Week, and Emails pages are drill-downs accessed from their respective dashboard sections, not sidebar entries.

## Consequences

- Clean, focused navigation
- Users discover drill-down pages by interacting with the dashboard, not by browsing the sidebar
- Week page returns to sidebar when weekly planning ships (post-MVP)
