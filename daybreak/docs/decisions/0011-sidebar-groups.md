# ADR-0011: Sidebar groups: Today + Workspace

**Date:** 2026-02
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

Need a grouping structure for the 4 sidebar items that makes conceptual sense.

## Decision

Two groups: "Today" (Dashboard) and "Workspace" (Actions, Inbox, Accounts/Projects). Clean two-group structure.

## Consequences

- Simple mental model: "what's happening today" vs "my persistent workspace"
- Four items total for both profiles — no scrolling needed
