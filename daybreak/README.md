# Daybreak

> Open the app. Your day is ready.

**Status:** Foundation / Pre-Development

## The Idea

Daybreak is an AI-powered executive assistant for everyone—not just executives.

You open the app. Your day is already prepared: meetings with context, actions surfaced, emails summarized. You read, review, act. The system did the work while you weren't looking.

No terminal. No commands. No maintenance. No guilt.

## Foundation Documents

Before we write code, we're writing philosophy. These documents are our north star and guardrails:

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [PHILOSOPHY.md](docs/PHILOSOPHY.md) | Why we exist. The manifesto. Core beliefs about AI-native productivity. |
| [PRINCIPLES.md](docs/PRINCIPLES.md) | How we make decisions. Design principles that guide every feature. |
| [VISION.md](docs/VISION.md) | What we're building. Product vision, target user, success criteria. |

**Read these first.** Everything else flows from them.

## The One-Liner

Traditional productivity tools are filing cabinets that demand your maintenance.

Daybreak is an assistant that shows up with your day already prepared.

---

## Core Beliefs

**Your brain shouldn't have a landlord.** Local-first. Markdown files. You own your data.

**AI-native, not AI-assisted.** The system operates. You leverage.

**Zero-guilt design.** Skip a day, nothing breaks. The system catches up, not you.

**An EA for everyone.** The cognitive burden reduction executives get should be available to all knowledge workers.

## Relationship to DailyOS

**DailyOS** is the proof of concept—CLI-native, built on Claude Code, where we test approaches.

**Daybreak** is the destination—same primitives underneath, wrapped in an interface for non-technical users.

Same skills. Same agents. Same files. Different interface.

## Status

We are in the **foundation phase**:

- [x] Philosophy documented
- [x] Design principles established
- [x] Product vision defined
- [ ] Technical architecture (next)
- [ ] Proof of concept
- [ ] Alpha release

## Contributing

This project is in early formation. If the philosophy resonates, watch this space.

When we're ready for code contributions, we'll document how.
