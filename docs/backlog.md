# Backlog

## Sprint 18 - Focus and Meeting Intelligence

### Completed

- [x] I214: Focus page "Other Priorities" now shows only P1 actions, capped to 5, with conditional "View All Actions (N)".
- [x] I188: Prep agenda generation is now calendar-anchored when `calendarNotes` contains agenda content.
- [x] I179: Verification-only in this sprint; deterministic prioritization behavior confirmed with regression tests.

### Notes

- Sprint 18 stayed quality-first and narrow: no net-new ranking model changes beyond I214 UX curation.
