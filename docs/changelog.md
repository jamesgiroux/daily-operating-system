# Changelog Notes

## Unreleased

- Backlog: revisit UX copy for base-prep mode messaging (`Base Prep` badge + `Run Briefing`/status tooltips) to align final product language.
- Closed `I177`: email sync now reports structured health (`sync`), preserves last-known-good payloads on fetch/delivery failure, emits unified `email-sync-status` events, and shows persistent dashboard retry UX.
