# 0.7.1 Fast-Follow Metrics

## Commands

- Binary size snapshot: `./scripts/measure_binary_size.sh`
- Frontend bundle report: `./scripts/measure_bundle_size.sh`
- Startup timing markers: inspect `dailyos` logs for startup command latency rollups and command timing warnings.

## Baseline / After

| Metric | Baseline | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Release binary size (bytes) | TBD | TBD |
| Release binary size (MiB) | TBD | TBD |
| Frontend dist total bytes | TBD | TBD |
| Largest frontend chunk | TBD | TBD |
| Cold startup p95 command latency | TBD | TBD |

## Notes

- `scripts/measure_bundle_size.sh` writes `docs/bundle-size-report.txt`.
- Use the same machine/profile for baseline and after numbers.
