# Acme Corp — Quarterly Business Review

**Date:** January 15, 2026
**Attendees:** Sarah Chen (VP Product, Acme), Marcus Johnson (Head of Engineering, Acme), You

## Discussion

Acme has rolled out to 3 additional teams since last quarter, bringing total active users to 340. Sarah highlighted that the product team has integrated our API into their internal tooling, which she considers a major win. NPS from the latest survey came in at 72, up from 58.

Marcus raised concerns about API latency during peak hours (>500ms p99). He's asked for a performance review meeting with our engineering team before end of month. The team is also evaluating a competitor for a specific analytics use case — Sarah flagged this as exploratory, not a replacement risk.

## Decisions

- Agreed to schedule a joint architecture review with Marcus's team by January 31
- Acme will pilot the new dashboard feature with their product analytics group
- Renewal conversation to start in March (current contract ends June 30)

## Action Items

- [ ] Schedule architecture review meeting with Marcus by Jan 31
- [ ] Send Acme the beta access link for new dashboard features
- [ ] Prepare renewal proposal draft for Sarah — include multi-year option
- [ ] Follow up on API latency data — pull p99 metrics for last 30 days
- [ ] Share competitive analysis positioning doc with Sarah

## Wins

- Expanded from 5 teams to 8 teams — organic growth without sales push
- NPS increased from 58 to 72
- Product team built internal tooling on our API (deep integration signal)

## Risks

- API latency concern from engineering leadership — could become blocker
- Competitor evaluation for analytics (exploratory but worth monitoring)
- Contract renewal in 5 months — need to start conversation early
