# ADR-0012: Profile indicator in sidebar header

**Date:** 2026-02
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

Users need to see which profile is active and eventually switch profiles.

## Decision

Show current profile below the app name in the sidebar header. Phase 2: make it clickable to switch (Slack workspace switcher pattern).

## Consequences

- Profile is always visible but not intrusive
- Switching mechanism has a natural home when it ships
