## System Notes

**Implementation:**
1. Store quotes in JSON: `{ "context": "no_actions", "quote": "text", "attribution": "Character, Show", "suffix": "contextual addition" }`
2. Random selection (5-10% chance per empty state)
3. Personality picker controls: Professional (skip), Encouraging (mild), Witty (show these)
4. Version in releases: add 5-10 new quotes per version to keep fresh
5. Future: user-contributed quotes (I220 - community quote submission)

**Quote Quality Control:**
- Must be recognizable to fans but accessible to non-fans
- Contextual suffix explains the joke if needed
- Rotation prevents fatigue
- Easter egg feel: delight when discovered, not overwhelming

**Sources for Updates:**
- Succession, Schitt's Creek, What We Do in the Shadows, Ted Lasso, Derry Girls, Fleabag
- More obscure UK comedy: Black Books, Peep Show, Spaced, I.T. Crowd deep cuts
- Classic: Blackadder, Fawlty Towers, Monty Python

**User Extension (Future - I220):**
- Settings > Intelligence Hygiene > Empty State Quotes > "Add Your Own"
- Format: Quote + Attribution + Context (which empty state)
- Community pool (optional sharing with other users?)
