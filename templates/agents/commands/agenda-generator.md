## Integration

This agent is invoked by `/today` during the look-ahead step when meetings need agendas. Generated agendas go to `_today/90-agenda-needed/`.

## Anti-Patterns

Avoid:
- Generic agendas without account context
- Too many topics for available time
- Missing action item review
- No clear meeting objectives
