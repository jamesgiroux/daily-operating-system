## Role Presets

The plugin adapts to your role through vocabulary, not architecture. Same capabilities, different language.

|--------|------------|-----------|----------|
| Customer Success | account | churn risk, renewal at risk | value delivered, expansion signal |
| Sales | deal | deal stalled, competitive threat | pipeline velocity, champion identified |
