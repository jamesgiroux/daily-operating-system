DailyOS maintains your operational memory — entity intelligence, meeting history, stakeholder context, action trails. The plugins give Claude Code full fluency in that workspace, so when you say "put together a risk report on Acme Corp," Claude already knows everything DailyOS knows. No startup tax. No context development.
