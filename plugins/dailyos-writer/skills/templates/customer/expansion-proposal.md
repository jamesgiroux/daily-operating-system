# Expansion Proposal Template

Customer-facing proposal for expanding the relationship—new capabilities, additional business units, or increased scope.

## When to Use

- Proposing new capabilities or services
- Cross-sell to new business units
- Upsell existing relationship
- Introducing new products to existing customers

## Core Principle

**Make their problem the hero, your solution the answer.**

Expansion isn't "here's what else we can sell you." It's "here's an opportunity we see in your business, and here's how we can help you capture it."

## Structure

### The Opportunity (2-3 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Frame the expansion around their business need.

**Guidance**:
- Start with what they're trying to accomplish
- Reference conversations, evidence, or observations
- Show you understand their priorities
- Connect to their stated strategy

**Questions to ask**:
- Am I starting with their need, not our product?
- Have I grounded this in actual conversations/evidence?
- Would they recognize this as their priority?

### The Recommendation (2-3 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: What you're proposing and why.

**Guidance**:
- Specific capability or expansion scope
- How it addresses the opportunity
- Why now (timing rationale)
- Connection to what's already working

**Questions to ask**:
- Is the recommendation specific and actionable?
- Does it clearly connect to the opportunity?
- Is the timing rationale compelling?

### The Investment and Value (1-2 paragraphs + table)

**Purpose**: Clear terms and expected return.

**Guidance**:
- Transparent pricing
- Expected outcomes (quantified if possible)
- Timeline to value
- Risk acknowledgment if appropriate

**Questions to ask**:
- Is pricing clear and fair?
- Is value framed in their terms?
- Have I been honest about timeline and assumptions?

### The Path Forward (1 paragraph)

**Purpose**: Clear next steps to proceed.

**Guidance**:
- Specific next action
- Who needs to be involved
- Timeline for decision
- Make it easy to say yes

**Questions to ask**:
- Is the next step crystal clear?
- Have I made proceeding easy?
- Is my ask reasonable?

## Anti-Patterns

- **Product-first framing** - "We have this new thing" vs. "You have this opportunity"
- **Missing context** - Proposal without grounding in their situation
- **Vague value** - "This will improve things" vs. specific expected outcomes
- **Pushy close** - "You need to act now" vs. genuine urgency rationale
- **One-size-fits-all** - Generic proposal that could be sent to anyone

## Expansion Triggers

Good expansion proposals connect to genuine triggers:

| Trigger Type | Example |
|--------------|---------|
| **Strategic shift** | "Given your focus on personalization in 2026..." |
| **Observed friction** | "The bottleneck you mentioned in APAC publishing..." |
| **Success building** | "Given the results from the pilot..." |
| **Market change** | "With Salesforce's Agentforce launch..." |
| **Organizational growth** | "As you bring on the European team..." |

## Example

```markdown
# Agentforce Integration: A Proposal for Cox Automotive

## The Opportunity

During our September strategy session, you mentioned dealer response time as a key friction point. Dealers waiting hours for answers that should take minutes. You estimated this costs 15 dealer-hours per day across your network.

With Salesforce's Agentforce now operational in your environment, there's an opportunity to address this directly. AI-powered dealer support that responds immediately, with human escalation for complex issues.

You've already invested in the Salesforce infrastructure. This is about activating it for a high-impact use case.

## Our Recommendation

Implement the WordPress VIP Agentforce Connector to power intelligent dealer support on your existing content platform.

This builds on your current WordPress VIP deployment and your Salesforce Data Cloud investment. No new infrastructure—just a bridge between what you already have.

### What This Includes
- Agentforce Connector deployment
- Integration with your existing dealer content library
- Training and enablement for your team
- Ongoing support and optimization

We recommend starting with a 50-dealer pilot in February, then expanding based on results.

## Investment and Value

### Investment
| Component | Investment |
|-----------|------------|
| Connector license | $40K/year |
| Implementation services | $30K one-time |
| **Total Year 1** | **$70K** |

### Expected Outcomes
Based on the POC results, we expect:
- 60% reduction in dealer inquiry response time
- 15 dealer-hours/day recovered for higher-value activities
- Scalable support model for your 5,000+ dealer network

### Timeline
- February: 50-dealer pilot launch
- March: Results review and optimization
- April: Decision on full rollout

## Next Steps

Let's schedule a 30-minute call to review the pilot scope and dealer selection. I'll have the pilot agreement ready for your review.
