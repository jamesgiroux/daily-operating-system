# Renewal Case Template

Customer-facing narrative building the case for renewal by demonstrating value delivered and future value potential.

## When to Use

- Renewal conversations (60-90 days before)
- Value justification documents
- Stakeholder alignment before renewal
- Risk mitigation for at-risk renewals

## Core Principle

**Frame renewal as their success, not our retention.**

This isn't "please stay with us." It's "here's what you've accomplished and what's ahead." The renewal should feel like a natural continuation of their journey.

## Structure

### Value Delivered (3-4 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Evidence of what they've accomplished with us.

**Guidance**:
- Specific outcomes in their metrics, not ours
- Reference their stated goals from kickoff/previous year
- Quantify where possible
- Tell the story of their success

**Questions to ask**:
- Am I using their language for success?
- Is every claim supported by evidence?
- Would their stakeholder recognize these outcomes?

### Journey Acknowledgment (1-2 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Show you understand their experience.

**Guidance**:
- Acknowledge challenges we worked through together
- Recognize the partnership, not just the transaction
- Be honest about any issues and how we addressed them
- Show continuity and institutional knowledge

**Questions to ask**:
- Am I being honest about the full experience?
- Does this feel like a partner, not a vendor?
- Have I shown I understand their context?

### Future Value (2-3 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: What they'll gain by continuing.

**Guidance**:
- Align with their stated future priorities
- Specific capabilities or opportunities ahead
- What continuation enables vs. switching costs
- Frame as building on what's working

**Questions to ask**:
- Am I connecting to their roadmap, not our features?
- Is the future value specific, not generic?
- Does this feel like acceleration, not dependency?

### The Ask (1 paragraph)

**Purpose**: Clear next step.

**Guidance**:
- Specific terms being proposed
- Timeline for decision
- Who to contact
- Make it easy to say yes

**Questions to ask**:
- Is the ask clear and specific?
- Have I made renewal easy?
- Is the timeline reasonable?

## Anti-Patterns

- **Vendor-centric framing** - "We delivered" vs. "You achieved"
- **Feature listing** - What we have vs. what they accomplished
- **Fear tactics** - Emphasizing switching costs vs. continuation value
- **Ignoring challenges** - Pretending everything was perfect
- **Generic value props** - "Enterprise-grade reliability" without their evidence

## Example

```markdown
# Hilton Domestic Partnership Renewal

## What You've Accomplished

### Zero Revenue-Impacting Outages During Peak Season
Your busiest booking periods ran without interruption. Thanksgiving week traffic was 3x baseline, and every booking completed as expected. This was a specific goal you set last January.

### Content Velocity Improved 40%
Time from content creation to publish dropped from 5 days to 3 days. Your marketing team cited this as enabling the summer campaign launches that drove 15% booking lift.

### Global Team Onboarded Successfully
The APAC team is now fully productive on the platform, publishing content independently across 8 markets without bottlenecks in the US team.

---

## The Journey

This wasn't always smooth. The APAC onboarding took longer than planned—we underestimated the training needs for multilingual workflows. We learned from that, and the revised approach worked. The trust your team showed through that process meant a lot.

When the peak season traffic exceeded our initial projections, the escalation response worked as designed. Your team and ours collaborated well under pressure.

---

## What's Ahead

You've told us 2026 is about personalization—using first-party data to create more relevant content experiences. The foundation you've built makes this possible:

### Opportunities on the Horizon
- **Personalization integration**: Your CDP investment can now connect to content delivery
- **Additional properties**: The model that worked for Domestic can extend to your international portfolio
- **AI content workflows**: Early access to capabilities we're building for exactly your use case
