# QBR Narrative Template

Customer-centric quarterly review narrative. Frames everything in their terms, their goals, their metrics.

## When to Use

- Quarterly business review preparation
- Executive summary for customer stakeholders
- Renewal conversations
- Any customer-facing value summary

## Core Principle

**Their success is the story, not our platform.**

| Platform-Centric (Avoid) | Customer-Centric (Prefer) |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| WordPress VIP delivered 99.99% uptime | Your critical launches had zero revenue-impacting outages |
| Our CDN improved performance by 23% | Your Core Web Vitals improved 23%, supporting your SEO goals |
| We resolved 50 support tickets | Your team's questions were resolved with 99% SLA compliance |

## Structure

### Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)

**Purpose**: The quarter in one breath.

**Guidance**:
- Lead with their biggest outcome
- Reference their stated goals
- Set up the narrative

**Questions to ask**:
- Is this framed in their priorities?
- Would their exec recognize their goals?

### Goals Alignment (2-3 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Connect their priorities to what happened.

**Guidance**:
- Start with their stated goals (from kickoff, previous QBR, etc.)
- Show how the quarter addressed those goals
- Be honest about what was and wasn't achieved

**Questions to ask**:
- Am I referencing their actual stated priorities?
- Am I being honest about gaps?

### Value Delivered (3-4 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Specific outcomes in their terms.

**Guidance**:
- Quantified where possible
- In their metrics, not ours
- Specific examples and evidence
- Connect to business impact

**Questions to ask**:
- Are outcomes in their terms?
- Is there specific evidence for each claim?
- Would their CFO care about these metrics?

### Platform Health (1-2 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Technical foundation supporting their success.

**Guidance**:
- Only the metrics that matter to them
- Translated to business terms
- Brief - this supports the narrative, not the focus

**Questions to ask**:
- Is this relevant to their priorities?
- Am I translating technical to business?

### Forward Look (2-3 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Recommendations aligned with their roadmap.

**Guidance**:
- Based on their stated future priorities
- Specific recommendations
- Tied to value they'll realize
- Clear next steps

**Questions to ask**:
- Do recommendations align with their roadmap?
- Is the value framing in their terms?
- Are next steps clear?

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Feature dumping**: Listing what we did without their outcome
- **VIP-centric framing**: "WordPress VIP enabled..." instead of "Your team achieved..."
- **Generic value props**: "Enterprise-grade reliability" without their specific evidence
- **Ignoring challenges**: Not acknowledging known issues
- **Vendor positioning**: Sounding like we're selling, not partnering

# Cox Automotive Q4 2025 Partnership Review

## Executive Summary

Cox Automotive achieved zero revenue-impacting outages during your highest-traffic quarter, supporting $2.3B in vehicle transactions processed through your digital platforms. The NADA project kicked off successfully, positioning Cox for AI-powered customer experiences in 2026.

---

## Your Goals This Quarter

At our September kickoff, you identified three priorities:

| Goal | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| Platform stability for Q4 traffic peak | Achieved | Zero outages during NADA season |
| Agentforce POC launch | Achieved | POC environment live, demo ready for NADA |
| Reduce time-to-publish for dealer content | In Progress | 30% improvement; targeting 50% by Q1 |

The Agentforce POC represents a significant milestone. Cox is now the lighthouse customer for WordPress VIP's Salesforce integration, with direct access to the product team during development.

## Value Delivered

### Zero Revenue-Impacting Outages During Peak Season
Your November traffic was 40% above baseline. Despite this, all customer-facing platforms maintained 99.99% availability. No dealer transactions were impacted.

### Agentforce POC Operational
The NADA use case is live in POC environment. Initial demos show 60% reduction in common dealer inquiry resolution time. Full deployment planned for Q1.

### Dealer Content Velocity Improved 30%
Time from content creation to publish reduced from 4 days to 2.8 days. Remaining friction identified; roadmap in place for Q1 improvements.

## Platform Health

| Metric | Result | Business Impact |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Uptime | 99.99% | Zero revenue-impacting outages |
| Avg. Response Time | 180ms | Supports Core Web Vitals targets |
| Support SLA | 98% within target | Your team's questions answered promptly |

## Looking Ahead: Q1 2026

### Your Priorities
You've identified NADA Conference (January) as the critical milestone for Agentforce demonstration, with full dealer rollout targeted for Q2.

### Our Recommendations

1. **Accelerate Agentforce deployment post-NADA**: Based on POC results, we recommend moving to production pilot with 50 dealers in February. This builds momentum before Q2 rollout.

2. **Content velocity sprint**: Addressing remaining friction in the publish workflow could get you to your 50% improvement target by end of Q1.

### Next Steps
- **January 15**: NADA Agentforce demo (James supporting)
- **January 22**: Q1 planning call to finalize pilot dealer selection
- **February 1**: Production pilot kickoff (pending NADA results)
