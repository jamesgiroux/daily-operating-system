# Customer Executive Briefing Template

A tight pre-meeting document for customer executives who need context before a strategic conversation.

## When to Use

- Pre-meeting prep for executive stakeholders
- Context document before QBR or strategic review
- Briefing for new stakeholder joining account
- Alignment document before critical decision meeting

## Core Principle

**Their time is precious—respect it ruthlessly.**

Customer executives scan faster than ours. Every sentence must earn its place. Give them exactly what they need to walk into the meeting ready.

## Structure

### Context (2-3 sentences)

**Purpose**: Why we're meeting and what's at stake.

**Guidance**:
- What's the meeting about
- Why now
- What needs to happen
- No fluff, no history lesson

**Questions to ask**:
- Does every word earn its place?
- Would they know why this matters?
- Can this be shorter?

### Key Points (3-4 bullets)

**Purpose**: What they need to know.

**Guidance**:
- Front-load the most important information
- One idea per bullet
- Conclusion first, then support
- In their language, tied to their priorities

**Questions to ask**:
- If they only read the bullets, would they be prepared?
- Am I telling them what matters to them?
- Are these conclusions, not topics?

### Decision/Discussion Points (2-3 bullets)

**Purpose**: What we need from the meeting.

**Guidance**:
- Specific decisions needed
- Topics requiring their input
- Clear what their role is
- What success looks like for the meeting

**Questions to ask**:
- Would they know what they're being asked?
- Is their role in the meeting clear?
- Have I been specific about decisions?

### Preparation (optional, 1-2 bullets)

**Purpose**: Anything they should review or consider beforehand.

**Guidance**:
- Only if genuinely needed
- Keep minimal—don't assign homework
- Links to relevant docs if necessary
- "No preparation required" is valid

**Questions to ask**:
- Is this actually necessary?
- Am I respecting their time?
- Is the preparation doable?

## Anti-Patterns

- **Background bloat** - Too much context
- **Agenda masquerading as briefing** - Just a list of topics
- **Vendor-centric framing** - "We want to discuss..." vs. "The question is..."
- **Hidden asks** - Decisions buried in text
- **No outcomes** - What success looks like unclear

## Length Guidance

| Executive Level | Maximum Length |
|-----------------|----------------|
| C-suite | 200 words |
| VP | 300 words |
| Director | 400 words |

Shorter is almost always better.

## Preparation
None required. Supporting data in the attached deck if you want detail.

- Bold the conclusions within bullets
- White space helps skimmability
- No more than one attachment reference
