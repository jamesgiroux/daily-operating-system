# Competitive Win Template

Document a competitive win with the evidence and insights that make it valuable for the broader organization.

## When to Use

- Deal closes against a named competitor
- Strategic win that others can learn from
- Pattern emerges that should inform positioning
- Sales or marketing needs case study material

## Core Principle

**Extract the pattern, not just the victory.**

A win story is only valuable if others can learn from it. Focus on what made this winnable, not just that you won.

## Structure

### The Headline (1-2 sentences)

**Purpose**: The win in one breath.

**Guidance**:
- Customer name, competitor displaced, key metric
- Make it scannable
- Include the "why it matters" hook

**Format**: "[Customer] chose [Us] over [Competitor] because [Key Differentiator] - [Impact/Size]"

**Questions to ask**:
- Would someone understand the win from this alone?
- Is the competitor named (where appropriate)?
- Is the key differentiator clear?

### Context (2-3 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Set up the competitive situation.

**Guidance**:
- What was the customer trying to accomplish?
- Who were they evaluating?
- What were the decision criteria?
- What was at stake?

**Questions to ask**:
- Do I understand why they were looking in the first place?
- Is the competitive context clear?
- Am I explaining the decision landscape?

### Why We Won (2-3 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: The specific factors that tipped the decision.

**Guidance**:
- Be specific—not "better product" but which capabilities
- Distinguish table stakes from differentiators
- Include customer quotes where possible
- Acknowledge what the competitor did well

**Categories to consider**:
- Technical capability
- Strategic alignment
- Relationship/trust
- Commercial terms
- Risk perception
- Integration/ecosystem

**Questions to ask**:
- Would someone else be able to replicate these factors?
- Am I specific enough to be actionable?
- Have I been honest about what the competitor offered?

### What the Competition Got Wrong (1-2 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Competitor weaknesses that we can exploit again.

**Guidance**:
- Specific failures, not generalizations
- Focus on repeatable patterns
- Avoid gloating—stay analytical
- Acknowledge where they were strong

**Questions to ask**:
- Is this a pattern or a one-time failure?
- Can we exploit this in future deals?
- Am I being fair in my assessment?

### The Insight (1 paragraph)

**Purpose**: The generalizable learning.

**Guidance**:
- What does this tell us about our positioning?
- What should others look for in similar situations?
- How does this change our competitive playbook?
- Be actionable

**Questions to ask**:
- Is this insight new or just confirming what we knew?
- Can sales/marketing use this?
- Am I being specific enough to act on?

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Gloating** - "We crushed them" vs. analytical assessment
- **Vagueness** - "They liked us better" vs. specific factors
- **Single-factor attribution** - Usually multiple factors
- **Ignoring competitor strengths** - Makes analysis less credible
- **No learning** - Victory lap without insight

## Voice Guidance

| Avoid | Prefer |
|-------|--------|
| "They couldn't compete with our superior..." | "The deciding factor was our ability to..." |
| "We beat [Competitor]" | "[Customer] chose us over [Competitor]" |
| "[Competitor] failed to..." | "[Competitor] didn't address [specific need]" |
| "We're clearly the best" | "This win suggests strength in [area]" |

## Example

```markdown
# Competitive Win: NXP Chooses WordPress VIP Over Contentful

**The Win**: NXP selected WordPress VIP for their enterprise content platform over Contentful, citing integration flexibility and total cost of ownership—$400K initial contract with expansion potential.

---

## The Situation

NXP was consolidating fragmented content systems across 12 regional marketing teams. Their Salesforce investment (Data Cloud, Agentforce) created requirements for native integration that became the deciding factor.

They evaluated WordPress VIP, Contentful, and Sitecore. Decision criteria were: Salesforce integration, global scalability, time-to-value, and 5-year TCO.

## Why We Won

### Key Differentiators
- **Salesforce native integration**: Our Agentforce connector was the only solution that didn't require custom middleware. Contentful would have needed $150K+ in integration work.
- **Total cost of ownership**: Contentful's headless approach required more frontend development. 5-year TCO was 30% higher.
- **Flexibility with guardrails**: They wanted editorial freedom with enterprise governance. Headless was too much freedom; Sitecore was too rigid.

NXP's VP of Digital said: "We need a platform that grows with our Salesforce investment, not one we have to work around."

## Competitor Analysis

Contentful competed hard on modern architecture and developer experience. They were strong on API-first positioning but couldn't answer the Salesforce integration question without adding cost and complexity.

**Pattern to note**: In accounts with significant Salesforce investment, native integration is becoming a table-stakes requirement. Contentful (and other headless players) don't have a good answer.

---

## The Takeaway

Salesforce integration is emerging as a differentiator in enterprise content platform decisions. Sales should probe early for Salesforce ecosystem commitments—these accounts are strong targets for our Agentforce positioning.
