# BLUF Standard Template

Bottom Line Up Front structure for strategic communications. Best for busy executives who need the conclusion first.

## When to Use

- Executive audience that scans before reading
- Time-sensitive updates
- Clear outcome to communicate
- Need decision or awareness, not exploration

## Structure

### BLUF (1-2 sentences)

**Purpose**: The conclusion, right at the top.

**Guidance**:
- State the outcome or key message first
- Answer: "What do I need to know?"
- No setup, no context first
- One clear takeaway

**Questions to ask**:
- If they only read this, would they get the point?
- Is this the actual conclusion, not just a preview?
- Is it specific enough to be useful?

### What Happened (2-4 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: The evidence and events supporting the BLUF.

**Guidance**:
- Specific events with dates
- Named stakeholders where appropriate
- Quantified where possible
- Evidence, not interpretation (yet)

**Questions to ask**:
- Is every claim grounded in specific evidence?
- Are there names, dates, numbers?
- Could someone verify this?

### What This Means (2-3 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Implications and interpretation.

**Guidance**:
- Strategic significance
- How this connects to broader goals
- Why this matters beyond the immediate
- Honest assessment (including risks)

**Questions to ask**:
- What's the "so what"?
- How does this connect to what the reader cares about?
- Am I being honest about implications?

### What's Next (1-2 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Clear next steps with owners.

**Guidance**:
- Specific actions
- Named owners
- Dates or timeframes
- What you need from the reader (if anything)

**Questions to ask**:
- Is each action specific enough to execute?
- Does every action have an owner?
- Is the ask clear?

## Anti-Patterns

- **Burying the lead** - Starting with context instead of conclusion
- **Topic headers** - "Update" instead of "Partnership advances to legal review"
- **Vague next steps** - "Continue discussions" without specifics
- **Missing evidence** - Claims without supporting detail

## Header Guidance

**Use action titles (conclusions, not topics)**:

| Topic Header (Bad) | Action Title (Good) |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Partnership Update | Salesforce partnership advances to legal review |
| NXP Opportunity | NXP deal validates Agentforce positioning |
| Q4 Results | Q4 exceeded targets: $2.1M closed |

---

## Template

```markdown

---

## What Happened

- [Specific event/quote with date]
- [Data point with source]
- [Stakeholder action with name]

## What This Means

- Strategic significance
- Connection to broader goals
- Honest assessment of implications

## What's Next

[1-2 paragraphs of actions]
- **[Owner]**: [Specific action] by [date]
- **[Owner]**: [Specific action] by [date]

```

## Example

```markdown
# Salesforce Partnership Advances to Legal Review

**BLUF**: After three months of technical validation, the Agentforce WordPress Connector partnership is moving to legal review with a target close of February 2026.

---

## What Happened

On January 8, Jared (Salesforce Partner Manager) confirmed legal engagement would begin this week. This follows:
- Successful Dreamforce theater session (October 2025)
- MCP Beta Program enrollment (January 2026)
- NXP co-sell opportunity identified ($400K potential)

Technical validation is complete. Both teams have aligned on the connector architecture and go-to-market approach.

## What This Means

This moves us from proof-of-concept to formal partnership status. Once signed:
- VIP gains access to AppExchange distribution
- Salesforce sellers can formally include us in deals
- Marketing co-investment becomes available

The NXP deal ($400K) is the first test of the co-sell motion. If it closes, it validates the commercial model.

## What's Next

- **Riley**: Lead legal negotiation (target: Feb close)
- **James**: Support NXP pursuit with technical POV
- **Abdul**: Finalize MVP scope for February beta
- **Ask**: None - informational update
```
