# Executive Briefing Template

A tight one-pager designed for executive consumption. Everything they need to know, nothing they don't.

## When to Use

- Pre-meeting context document
- Board or leadership updates
- Stakeholder alignment documents
- Any situation where attention is scarce and stakes are high

## Core Principle

**Respect their time, earn their attention.**

Executives scan, they don't read. Structure for skimmability. Every word must earn its place.

## Design Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **30-second scan** | They should get the point from headers alone |
| **No surprises** | Lead with the most important information |
| **Decision-ready** | Clear what you need from them |
| **Self-contained** | No required pre-reading |

## Structure

### Context (2-3 sentences)

**Purpose**: Minimum viable context to understand what follows.

**Guidance**:
- What situation or decision is this about?
- Why does it matter now?
- Assume intelligent reader, not informed reader
- No throat-clearing, no history lessons

**Questions to ask**:
- Is every sentence necessary?
- Would they understand this with no other context?
- Am I explaining or over-explaining?

### Key Points (3-4 bullets)

**Purpose**: The essential information in scannable form.

**Guidance**:
- Lead each bullet with the conclusion, not the setup
- Front-load the most important information
- One idea per bullet
- Parallel structure across bullets

**Bullet structure**:
- ❌ "After analyzing the data, we found that..."
- ✓ "Revenue grew 23% ($2.3M → $2.8M)"

**Questions to ask**:
- If they only read the bullets, would they get it?
- Is each bullet a complete thought?
- Am I burying anything important in the middle?

### Implications (2-3 sentences)

**Purpose**: What this means for them/the business.

**Guidance**:
- So what? Why should they care?
- Connect to their priorities
- Quantify impact where possible
- Be direct about stakes

**Questions to ask**:
- Have I answered "so what"?
- Is the implication relevant to their role?
- Am I being specific about impact?

### Ask (1-2 sentences)

**Purpose**: What you need from them.

**Guidance**:
- Crystal clear request or decision needed
- If no ask, state this is informational
- Make the next step obvious
- Specify timeline if relevant

**Questions to ask**:
- Is my ask unmistakably clear?
- Do they have what they need to respond?
- Is the timeline explicit?

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Background bloat** - Two paragraphs of context for one paragraph of content
- **Passive asks** - "It would be helpful to get thoughts" vs. "Please approve by Friday"
- **Hidden conclusions** - Key point buried in paragraph 3
- **Jargon** - Assuming they know acronyms and project names
- **Multiple asks** - More than one clear request

## Formatting Guidelines

- Keep to one page (400-600 words max)
- Use bold for key numbers and decisions
- White space is your friend
- Headers should tell the story alone

## Template

```markdown

## Example

```markdown
# Cox Automotive: Agentforce Pilot Approval Needed

## Context
Cox's Agentforce POC is complete and validated. They're asking to move to production pilot with 50 dealers in February. This requires our approval to expand beyond POC scope.

## Key Points
- **POC validated core use case**: 60% reduction in dealer inquiry resolution time
- **Customer is committed**: Cox identified budget and internal sponsor for rollout
- **Timeline pressure**: They want pilot live before Q2 planning cycle locks budgets
- **Our readiness**: Connector MVP is production-ready; support model defined

## Implications
A successful pilot positions Cox as our Agentforce lighthouse customer for the Salesforce partnership launch. Delay risks losing momentum and potentially the customer's internal champion.

## The Ask
Please approve expansion from POC to 50-dealer pilot by January 20. This lets Cox start deployment in February and builds our case study before the partnership announcement.
