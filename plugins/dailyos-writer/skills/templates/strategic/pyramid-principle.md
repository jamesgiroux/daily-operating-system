# Pyramid Principle Template

Barbara Minto's pyramid structure: lead with the answer, then support with grouped arguments, each backed by evidence.

## When to Use

- Executive communications where time is scarce
- Complex analysis that needs clear structure
- Recommendations requiring supporting arguments
- Any situation where the reader asks "so what?" before "why?"

## Core Principle

**Answer first, then explain.**

Executives don't read to discover your conclusion—they read to validate it. Give them the answer, then let them choose how deep to go.

## Structure

### The Answer (1 paragraph)

**Purpose**: State your main conclusion or recommendation upfront.

**Guidance**:
- One clear sentence stating your position
- Include the "so what" implication
- Make it concrete enough to act on
- Don't hedge—commit to a position

**Questions to ask**:
- If they read only this paragraph, would they know what to do?
- Is this specific enough to be useful?
- Am I being clear, not clever?

### Supporting Arguments (3-4 paragraphs, grouped)

**Purpose**: Provide the key reasons supporting your answer.

**Guidance**:
- Group into 2-4 supporting arguments (MECE: mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive)
- Each argument should stand on its own
- Order by impact or logic flow
- Use action titles that state conclusions, not topics

**Action title examples**:
- ❌ "Market Analysis" (topic)
- ✓ "Market demand exceeds our current capacity" (conclusion)

**Questions to ask**:
- Are my arguments MECE?
- Does each argument directly support the main answer?
- Would removing any argument weaken my case significantly?

### Evidence Layer (beneath each argument)

**Purpose**: Provide the data and examples that prove each argument.

**Guidance**:
- Specific data points, not vague assertions
- Link evidence directly to the argument it supports
- Include sources where relevant
- Quality over quantity—best evidence, not all evidence

**Questions to ask**:
- Is this evidence specific and verifiable?
- Does it directly prove the argument above it?
- Would a skeptic find this convincing?

### Next Steps (1 paragraph)

**Purpose**: Clear actions with owners and dates.

**Guidance**:
- Specific actions, not vague intentions
- Named owners (who will do this?)
- Concrete timelines
- Link back to the main recommendation

**Questions to ask**:
- Are next steps specific enough to execute?
- Do owners have agency to act?
- Is the timeline realistic?

## Anti-Patterns

- **Burying the lede** - Building up to the conclusion instead of leading with it
- **Topic headers** - "Background" instead of "Q4 results exceeded targets by 23%"
- **Evidence without argument** - Data dump without synthesis
- **Vague recommendations** - "We should consider..." instead of "We should do X"
- **Missing next steps** - Analysis without action

## Grouping Principles (MECE)

Your supporting arguments should be:
- **Mutually Exclusive**: No overlap between arguments
- **Collectively Exhaustive**: Together they cover all relevant ground

**Common groupings**:
- Time-based: Past / Present / Future
- Stakeholder-based: Customers / Company / Market
- Action-based: What to do / How to do it / When to do it
- Logic-based: Situation / Implication / Response

## Template

```markdown
# [Action Title Stating Your Recommendation]

[1 paragraph: Your main answer/recommendation. Clear, specific, actionable.]

---

## [Action Title for Argument 1]

[1-2 paragraphs: The argument and its supporting evidence]

## [Action Title for Argument 2]

[1-2 paragraphs: The argument and its supporting evidence]

## [Action Title for Argument 3]

[1-2 paragraphs: The argument and its supporting evidence]

## Next Steps

- **[Owner]**: [Specific action] by [date]
- **[Owner]**: [Specific action] by [date]
```

## Example

**Title**: "Approve the Agentforce Partnership Investment"

**Answer**: We should invest $200K in formalizing the Salesforce Agentforce partnership. The market timing is right, technical validation is complete, and we have a lighthouse customer ready to deploy.

**Argument 1: Market timing favors early movers**
Salesforce generated $100M in Agentforce bookings in year one. Partner ecosystem is still forming. Early entrants get preferential positioning before the market crowds.

**Argument 2: Technical risk is behind us**
Dreamforce demo validated the approach. Cox Automotive POC is operational. We're scaling proven technology, not speculating.

**Argument 3: Revenue opportunity is concrete**
NXP represents $400K in immediate pipeline. Three additional enterprise opportunities in active discussion. This isn't theoretical demand.

**Next Steps**:
- **Riley**: Lead partnership paperwork (target: Feb legal close)
- **Abdul**: Ensure MVP ready for partner launch
- **James**: Support NXP as proof point for co-sell model
