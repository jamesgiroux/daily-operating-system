# SCQA Template

Situation-Complication-Question-Answer framework from McKinsey. Best for framing strategic problems and proposals.

## When to Use

- Proposing a new initiative or approach
- Framing a strategic problem for decision
- Building the case for change
- When the audience needs to understand "why now"

## Structure

### Situation (1-2 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Establish the shared context everyone agrees on.

**Guidance**:
- Start with what's known and accepted
- Set the scene without controversy
- Create common ground
- Should be uncontroversial facts

**Questions to ask**:
- Would everyone nod in agreement?
- Is this the relevant context?
- Am I including only what matters for the argument?

### Complication (2-3 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Introduce what's changed or what's challenging the status quo.

**Guidance**:
- The tension that creates the need for action
- What's wrong, what's changed, what's at risk
- Build the case for "why now"
- Create urgency without hype

**Questions to ask**:
- Is the complication genuine and specific?
- Does it create natural urgency?
- Is it clear why the situation can't continue?

### Question (1 paragraph or implied)

**Purpose**: The strategic question that needs answering.

**Guidance**:
- Flows naturally from situation + complication
- Often implicit rather than stated
- The question the reader is now asking
- Frames the answer that follows

**Questions to ask**:
- Is this the question the audience would naturally ask?
- Does my answer actually answer this question?
- Is it the right question (not too broad, not too narrow)?

### Answer (remainder of document)

**Purpose**: Your recommendation or solution.

**Guidance**:
- Direct answer to the question
- Structured with supporting points
- Evidence for each point
- Clear next steps

**Questions to ask**:
- Does this actually answer the question?
- Is the answer specific enough to act on?
- Is there evidence for each supporting point?

## Anti-Patterns

- **Too much situation** - Spending half the document on context
- **Weak complication** - "Things are changing" without specifics
- **Missing urgency** - No clear "why now"
- **Answer doesn't fit question** - Recommendation that doesn't address the actual complication

## Example

```markdown
# WordPress VIP Should Formalize the Salesforce Partnership

## The Context

Salesforce generated over $100M in Agentforce bookings in year one. Their sales teams are actively looking for implementation partners. WordPress VIP has a working connector (demonstrated at Dreamforce) and a lighthouse customer (Cox Automotive) ready to deploy.

The technical foundation is in place. The market interest is validated.

## The Challenge

We're at a decision point. Without formal partnership status:
- Salesforce AEs can recommend us but can't formally include us in deals
- We miss AppExchange distribution (1000s of potential customers)
- Competitors with formal partnerships get preference in co-sell motions
- The NXP opportunity ($400K) is testing a model we can't scale without partnership infrastructure

The Dreamforce momentum is creating demand we're not positioned to capture. Three AEs reached out in the same week. Without partnership infrastructure, each deal requires ad-hoc coordination.

**The question**: Should we invest in formalizing the Salesforce partnership now?

## The Recommendation

Yes. Formal partnership should be a Q1 priority. Here's why:

### The Demand Is Here Now
Three enterprise opportunities in active discussion. NXP alone represents $400K. Waiting means losing deals to partners who can execute the co-sell motion.

### The Technical Risk Is Behind Us
Dreamforce validated the approach. Cox is deploying. The connector works. This isn't speculative investment; it's scaling what's proven.

### The Window May Close
Salesforce is actively building their partner ecosystem for Agentforce. Early movers get preferred positioning. Waiting means competing against established partners later.

## Next Steps

- **Riley**: Lead partnership formalization (target: Feb legal close)
- **James**: Support NXP as proof point for co-sell model
- **Abdul**: Ensure MVP is ready for partner launch
- **Decision needed**: Confirm this is a Q1 priority for leadership allocation
