# Explainer Template

Teach a complex concept by telling its story—where it came from, how it works, and why it matters.

## When to Use

- Explaining a technical concept to non-technical audience
- Making industry dynamics understandable
- Documentary-style educational content
- Video scripts that need to teach while engaging

## Core Principle

**Show before tell. Explain the mechanics before critiquing.**

Don't assume the reader understands the system you're discussing. Build their understanding piece by piece so your conclusions feel earned, not asserted.

## Structure

### The Hook (1-2 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Create curiosity about the concept.

**Guidance**:
- Start with a relatable scenario or question
- Create the "wait, how does that work?" feeling
- Don't explain yet—create the question
- Avoid jargon in the opening

**Questions to ask**:
- Would a newcomer be curious?
- Is there a question created?
- Am I accessible to someone who doesn't know this?

### The Mechanics (3-4 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Build understanding of how the system works.

**Guidance**:
- Start simple, add complexity progressively
- Use concrete examples, not abstractions
- Connect new concepts to familiar ones
- Assume intelligence but not knowledge

**Progression pattern**:
1. Simple version (the basic idea)
2. Why it's actually more complex
3. How the pieces interact
4. What this creates

**Questions to ask**:
- Could someone follow this without prior knowledge?
- Am I building understanding progressively?
- Are my examples concrete enough?

### The Implications (2-3 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: What this means—the "so what."

**Guidance**:
- Now you can critique or evaluate
- Connect to what the reader cares about
- Show why understanding this matters
- Move from descriptive to analytical

**Questions to ask**:
- Have I earned the right to offer opinion?
- Is the implication connected to my audience's concerns?
- Does this feel like a natural conclusion?

### The Human Element (1-2 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Ground the concept in human experience.

**Guidance**:
- Show how this affects real people
- Stories or examples that illustrate impact
- Make abstract concrete through human lens
- Connect head to heart

**Questions to ask**:
- Is there a human in this story?
- Can readers see themselves or others they know?
- Does this create emotional resonance?

### The Takeaway (1 paragraph)

**Purpose**: What to do with this understanding.

**Guidance**:
- How should they think differently?
- What should they watch for?
- How does this change their behavior?
- Light touch—not a prescriptive how-to

**Questions to ask**:
- Is there something actionable here?
- Does this feel like earned insight, not imposed advice?

## Anti-Patterns

- **Jargon dumping** - Using insider terms without explanation
- **Jumping to critique** - Opinions before building understanding
- **Abstract throughout** - Never grounding in concrete examples
- **Complexity signaling** - Showing off knowledge vs. creating understanding
- **Missing the human** - All mechanics, no people

## Voice Guidance

| Avoid | Prefer |
|-------|--------|
| "Obviously, the system..." | "Here's how the system works:" |
| "As everyone knows..." | "To understand this, start here:" |
| "It's complicated, but..." | "Let's build this up piece by piece." |
| "The problem is..." (too early) | "Here's how it works. Now let's look at where this breaks down." |

## Template

```markdown
# [Concept]: [What You'll Understand]

[1-2 paragraphs: The hook. A scenario or question that creates curiosity.]

---

## How It Works

[3-4 paragraphs: Build understanding progressively. Simple → complex. Concrete examples throughout.]

### The Basic Idea
[Simple version anyone can follow]

### The Complication
[Why it's actually more nuanced]

### The Moving Parts
[How the system operates in practice]

## What This Means

[2-3 paragraphs: Implications. Now you can critique, evaluate, offer perspective.]

## The Human Story

[1-2 paragraphs: Ground in human experience. Show impact on real people.]

---

## So What?

[1 paragraph: The takeaway. How should this change thinking or behavior?]

## Example

**Title**: "Why Enterprise Software Costs So Much (And Why That's Changing)"

**Hook**: You've seen the proposals. $500K for software that's free for consumers. $100K for "support" you never use. What's actually going on here?

**Mechanics**:
- The basic idea: Enterprise software prices include risk mitigation, not just features
- The complication: Vendor lock-in creates pricing power
- The moving parts: How procurement, IT, legal, and vendors interact to create these dynamics

**Implications**: This model is breaking down. Cloud, open source, and AI are changing the equation. Companies that built moats on switching costs are vulnerable.

**Human element**: Sarah, a CMO at a Fortune 500, just spent 8 months trying to replace her CMS. She describes the process that kept her locked in.

**Takeaway**: When evaluating enterprise software, ask: "What makes this hard to leave?" The vendors who can't answer that question are the ones betting on delivering value, not extracting rent.
