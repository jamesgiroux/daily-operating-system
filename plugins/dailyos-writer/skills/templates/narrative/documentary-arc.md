# Documentary Arc Template

Problem-solution arc with earned resolution. The Trudeau communication style: direct address, shared journey, show don't tell.

## When to Use

- Video scripts (thought leadership, explainers)
- Documentary-style content
- When positioning should emerge from argument
- When you want to create a shared journey with the viewer

## Core Principles

- **Show through stories, don't tell emotions**
- **Resolution is earned, not announced**
- **Explain mechanics before critiquing**
- **Let tension breathe before resolution**
- **Use "we" for shared journey**

## Structure

### Setup (20% of content)

**Purpose**: Establish the world and the problem.

**Guidance**:
- Open with something recognizable
- Show, don't tell, the challenge
- Create shared context with "we"
- Don't give away the resolution yet

**Questions to ask**:
- Am I showing the problem through specifics?
- Does the viewer feel "yes, I know this"?
- Is there enough tension to create investment?

### Tension (30% of content)

**Purpose**: Develop the complexity.

**Guidance**:
- Explain the mechanics of why this is hard
- Acknowledge the real challenges
- Let the tension breathe
- Don't rush to resolution

**Questions to ask**:
- Have I explained how we got here?
- Am I sitting in the difficulty long enough?
- Is the complexity real, not manufactured?

### Turn (20% of content)

**Purpose**: The insight or shift.

**Guidance**:
- This must feel earned by the preceding argument
- The "aha" moment
- Connect new thinking to established context
- Not a lecture, a revelation

**Questions to ask**:
- Does this feel earned?
- Would someone who watched closely anticipate this?
- Is it a genuine insight, not just a pivot?

### Resolution (30% of content)

**Purpose**: What this means, what's possible.

**Guidance**:
- Positioning flows naturally from the argument
- Show the path forward
- Make it feel achievable
- Don't oversell

**Questions to ask**:
- Does positioning emerge naturally?
- Am I showing what's possible, not claiming superiority?
- Does it complete the arc?

## Anti-Patterns

- **Telling instead of showing**: "This was frustrating" vs. showing the frustration
- **Unearned resolution**: Position inserted without argument support
- **Rushing mechanics**: Critique before explanation
- **Signposting**: "In this video, we'll cover..."
- **Announcing emotions**: "This is exciting because..."

## Pacing for Video

- **Hook**: First 10 seconds must earn attention
- **Variety**: New idea or example every 30-60 seconds
- **Tension peaks**: Build before resolution
- **Rhythm**: Vary sentence length for spoken delivery

# The DXP Trap

## SETUP

You're in a meeting. Someone says "we need a DXP." And everyone nods, because that's what you're supposed to want now.

But here's what we've noticed in conversations with enterprise teams: the same companies buying DXPs are also hiring agencies to escape them. Something doesn't add up.

## TENSION

Let's understand why DXPs exist. Fifteen years ago, managing digital content was a mess. Different systems for different channels. No personalization. Marketers waiting weeks for IT to publish a page.

DXPs solved that. One platform, everything integrated, marketers in control.

But here's what happened next. AI didn't just improve DXPs. It made their core value proposition... less valuable. The personalization that used to require a $500K platform? An API call. The integration that needed a monolithic suite? Open standards and connectors.

The platforms that promised to simplify everything? They're now the complexity.

## TURN

What if the future isn't a better DXP, but no DXP at all? What if the architecture that made sense in 2015 is now the problem?

The enterprises we're talking to aren't asking "which DXP should we buy?" They're asking "how do we get the benefits without the lock-in?"

## RESOLUTION

This is why architectural flexibility matters now more than it ever has. Not because open is ideologically better. Because the rate of change in AI means the platform you choose today needs to adapt to capabilities that don't exist yet.

We're seeing enterprises build on open foundations, integrate AI capabilities as they emerge, and move faster than their competitors who are waiting for vendor roadmaps.

The DXP era solved real problems. The post-DXP era is about not creating new ones.
