# Future Vision Template

Paint a vivid picture of a future state to inspire action toward it. Show what the world looks like when we succeed.

## When to Use

- Inspiring teams around a shared vision
- Strategy documents that need emotional pull
- Change management narratives
- Video scripts showing the destination

## Core Principle

**Make the future tangible enough to want.**

A good vision isn't abstract ("we'll be successful"). It's specific enough that people can see themselves in it, concrete enough to feel achievable, and compelling enough to motivate action toward it.

## Structure

### The Moment (1-2 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Drop the reader into a specific future scene.

**Guidance**:
- Start with a vivid, concrete moment
- Use present tense (as if we're already there)
- Show, don't tell—what does this look like?
- Make it specific enough to feel real

**Questions to ask**:
- Can I see this scene?
- Does it feel like a real moment, not an abstract goal?
- Would this be exciting if I were there?

### The Day-to-Day (2-3 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Show what life looks like in this future.

**Guidance**:
- Expand from the moment to the pattern
- What's different about how people work?
- What problems no longer exist?
- What new capabilities exist?

**Questions to ask**:
- Is this specific to our context?
- Can people imagine their daily work in this future?
- Have I shown the change, not just stated it?

### The Path Back (2-3 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Connect the vision to actions we can take.

**Guidance**:
- How did we get here? (Retrospective from the future)
- What key decisions made this possible?
- What did we have to build or change?
- Make it feel achievable, not magical

**Questions to ask**:
- Is the path believable?
- Can we see the connection to present actions?
- Does this feel achievable, not fantasy?

### The Invitation (1 paragraph)

**Purpose**: Call to action—join us in making this real.

**Guidance**:
- Bring it back to the present
- Acknowledge the work ahead
- Invite participation
- End with energy, not prescription

**Questions to ask**:
- Is there a clear invitation?
- Does this inspire action, not just agreement?
- Have I respected the reader's agency?

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Vague aspiration** - "We'll be the best" vs. specific picture
- **Magical thinking** - Future happens without clear path
- **All sunshine** - No acknowledgment of difficulty
- **Generic future** - Could be any company
- **Preaching** - Telling them what to want

## Voice Guidance

The future vision voice is:
- **Confident but not arrogant** - We can do this, but it requires effort
- **Specific but not prescriptive** - Here's what it could look like, not what it must be
- **Inviting but not demanding** - Join us, not you should

## Temporal Tricks

**Present tense for the vision**: "It's 2028. Sarah opens her dashboard and..."
**Past tense for the path**: "We made three key decisions in 2026..."
**Present tense for the invitation**: "This future isn't guaranteed. It's a choice we make..."

## Example

```markdown
# 2028

## The Moment

It's January 2028. Sarah, a CMO at a Fortune 500 financial services company, opens her laptop to find her AI assistant has already drafted responses to 40 customer inquiries that came in overnight—each one personalized, accurate, and ready for her team to review with a click.

Three years ago, this would have required a team of 20 working through the night. Today, it's a Tuesday morning.

## What's Different

The content experience has become genuinely intelligent. Not "smart" in the marketing sense—actually intelligent. The website understands context, anticipates questions, and adapts in real-time.

Marketers spend their time on strategy and creativity, not formatting and approvals. The infrastructure that used to consume 70% of their energy now runs itself. The platform doesn't just host content—it learns from every interaction and improves.

Customer satisfaction scores have climbed 40%. Time-to-publish dropped from weeks to hours. And the dreaded "replatform" conversations are ancient history—the system evolved continuously instead of requiring painful migrations.

## How We Got Here

It started in 2025 when we made three decisions:

First, we bet on openness. While others built walled gardens, we built bridges. When enterprises adopted AI, they found a platform that connected rather than constrained.

Second, we invested in infrastructure that adapts. Not "flexible" as a feature, but architecture designed from the ground up to evolve.

Third, we treated our customers as partners in building this future, not just buyers of features.

## The Invitation

This future isn't inevitable. Other paths exist—ones where marketing technology becomes more fragmented, more complex, more frustrating.

The future described here is a choice. It requires building things that don't yet exist, solving problems we don't fully understand yet, and staying committed to the long game when short-term alternatives tempt.

We're building toward this future. The question is whether you want to be part of making it real.
