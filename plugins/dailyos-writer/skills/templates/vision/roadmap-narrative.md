# Roadmap Narrative Template

Tell the story of a multi-phase strategic initiative—where we're going, how we'll get there, and why the phases make sense.

## When to Use

- Multi-quarter initiative planning
- Capability building programs
- Strategic transformation plans
- Product or process rollout narratives

## Core Principle

**Phases should earn each other.**

A good roadmap isn't arbitrary time slicing. Each phase creates the conditions for the next. The reader should understand why Phase 2 needs Phase 1 to come first.

## Structure

### The Destination (1-2 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Paint the picture of where we're headed.

**Guidance**:
- Start with the end state, not the current state
- Make it concrete and compelling
- Show what changes when we get there
- Create pull toward the vision

**Questions to ask**:
- Is the destination vivid enough to motivate?
- Would people want to get there?
- Is it specific enough to know when we've arrived?

### The Gap (2-3 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: The honest distance between here and there.

**Guidance**:
- Acknowledge current state frankly
- Identify what's missing (capabilities, resources, conditions)
- Show why we can't just leap there
- Create understanding of why phases are needed

**Questions to ask**:
- Am I being honest about where we are?
- Is the gap clear without being demoralizing?
- Does this explain why we need phases?

### Phase Structure (3-4 phases, 2-3 paragraphs each)

**Purpose**: The journey in logical stages.

**Guidance**:
- Each phase has a clear objective
- Show what must be true before the next phase
- Include success criteria and exit gates
- Connect each phase to what came before and what follows

**Phase anatomy**:
- **Objective**: What this phase accomplishes
- **Key activities**: What we do
- **Exit criteria**: How we know we're done
- **Sets up**: What this enables for next phase

**Questions to ask**:
- Is each phase's purpose distinct?
- Do phases logically build on each other?
- Are exit criteria clear and measurable?

### Dependencies and Risks (1-2 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Honest about what could go wrong.

**Guidance**:
- External dependencies
- Internal constraints
- Key risks and mitigation
- Build credibility through realism

**Questions to ask**:
- Have I identified real risks?
- Are mitigations credible?
- Does this feel realistic, not naive?

### Success Metrics (brief)

**Purpose**: How we'll know the roadmap is working.

**Guidance**:
- Overall success definition
- Phase-level metrics
- Leading indicators vs. lagging outcomes
- Keep it focused

**Questions to ask**:
- Would we know if we're on track?
- Are metrics measurable?
- Are we measuring the right things?

### Timeline (visual or narrative)

**Purpose**: When this happens.

**Guidance**:
- Calendar grounding for each phase
- Key milestones visible
- Realistic about duration
- Acknowledge uncertainty appropriately

**Questions to ask**:
- Is the timeline realistic?
- Are key dates visible?
- Have I acknowledged what I don't know?

## Anti-Patterns

- **Arbitrary phase slicing** - Q1/Q2/Q3 without logic
- **Missing dependencies** - Why this order isn't explained
- **No exit criteria** - Phase transitions are vibes
- **Naive optimism** - No risks acknowledged
- **Vague destination** - "Be better at X"

## Phase Transition Logic

Good roadmaps show why each phase comes in order:

**Wrong**: "Phase 1: Build connector. Phase 2: Add features. Phase 3: Scale."
**Right**: "Phase 1 (POC) validates core use case with one customer. This creates the proof point needed for Phase 2 (Product), where we build for repeatability. With product-market fit established, Phase 3 (Scale) expands to multiple verticals."

## Template

```markdown
# [Initiative Name]: A [Timeframe] Roadmap

## Where We're Going
[1-2 paragraphs: The destination. What the world looks like when we succeed. Make it vivid.]

## Where We Are Today
[2-3 paragraphs: Current state. The gap. Why we can't leap straight to the destination.]

## The Journey

### Phase 1: [Name] - [Timeframe]

**Objective**: [What this phase accomplishes]

**Key Activities**:
- [Activity 1]
- [Activity 2]
- [Activity 3]

**Exit Criteria**: [How we know we're ready for Phase 2]

**Sets Up**: [What this enables for next phase]

### Phase 2: [Name] - [Timeframe]

**Objective**: [What this phase accomplishes]

**Key Activities**:
- [Activity 1]
- [Activity 2]
- [Activity 3]

**Exit Criteria**: [How we know we're ready for Phase 3]

**Sets Up**: [What this enables for next phase]

### Phase 3: [Name] - [Timeframe]

**Objective**: [What this phase accomplishes]

**Key Activities**:
- [Activity 1]
- [Activity 2]
- [Activity 3]

**Success Criteria**: [How we know we've achieved the destination]

## Dependencies and Risks

**Dependencies**:
- [External dependency 1]
- [Internal constraint 1]

**Key Risks**:
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| [Risk 1] | [Impact] | [Mitigation] |
| [Risk 2] | [Impact] | [Mitigation] |

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Phase 1 Target | Phase 2 Target | Phase 3 Target |
|--------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| [Metric 1] | [Target] | [Target] | [Target] |
| [Metric 2] | [Target] | [Target] | [Target] |

## Timeline

## Example

See Agentforce project documentation (`Projects/Agentforce/05-Planning/`) for a real-world example of phased roadmap:
- Phase 1: POC with Cox (validate use case)
- Phase 2: MVP for partner launch (productize)
- Phase 3: Scale to vertical playbooks (expand)

Each phase has clear exit criteria and creates conditions for the next.
