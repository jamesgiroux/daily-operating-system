# Investment Case Template

Make the case for investing resources (budget, headcount, time) in an initiative.

## When to Use

- Requesting budget for a new initiative
- Proposing headcount allocation
- Seeking leadership prioritization
- Any situation where resources compete

## Core Principle

**Quantify the opportunity, acknowledge the risk.**

Investment decisions are about tradeoffs. Show the upside clearly, but build credibility by being honest about what could go wrong and what you don't know.

## Structure

### The Ask (1 paragraph)

**Purpose**: What you're requesting and what it enables.

**Guidance**:
- Specific amount/resource requested
- What this investment enables
- How it connects to strategic priorities
- Make the ask unmistakable

**Format**: "I'm requesting [specific resource] to [accomplish specific outcome]. This investment supports [strategic priority] and positions us to [opportunity]."

**Questions to ask**:
- Is the ask specific and quantified?
- Is the connection to strategy clear?
- Would a decision-maker know exactly what I need?

### The Opportunity (2-3 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: What we gain if we invest.

**Guidance**:
- Quantify the opportunity where possible
- Connect to business outcomes (revenue, efficiency, risk reduction)
- Show why this is better than alternatives
- Use conservative estimates, not best-case

**Questions to ask**:
- Are my numbers defensible?
- Is the opportunity significant enough to justify the ask?
- Have I connected to outcomes leadership cares about?

### The Investment Required (1-2 paragraphs + table)

**Purpose**: Exactly what this costs and what you get.

**Guidance**:
- Break down the investment clearly
- Include all resource types ($ + time + opportunity cost)
- Show what each component delivers
- Be thorough to build trust

**Questions to ask**:
- Have I accounted for hidden costs?
- Is the breakdown clear?
- Would finance find this credible?

### The Risk and Uncertainty (1-2 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Honest about what could go wrong.

**Guidance**:
- Key assumptions that could be wrong
- External dependencies
- What we'll learn and when
- Mitigation strategies

**Questions to ask**:
- Am I being genuinely honest about risk?
- Have I identified the key assumptions?
- Does this build or undermine credibility?

### The Decision (1 paragraph)

**Purpose**: Clear ask with timeline.

**Guidance**:
- What decision you need
- When you need it by
- What you'll do with approval
- Make it easy to say yes

**Questions to ask**:
- Is the next step crystal clear?
- Is the timeline reasonable?
- Have I made approval easy?

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Best-case-only projections** - Undermines credibility
- **Hidden costs** - Loses trust when discovered
- **No risk acknowledgment** - Seems naive
- **Vague returns** - "This will be valuable"
- **Passive ask** - "It would be good if..."

## ROI Framework

When quantifying opportunity:

**Revenue impact**:
- Direct revenue from initiative
- Revenue protected (churn prevention)
- Pipeline influenced

**Efficiency gains**:
- Time saved × cost of time
- Process improvements quantified
- Automation value

**Risk reduction**:
- Cost of inaction
- Competitive risk
- Technical debt avoided

## Example

```markdown
# Investment Case: Agentforce Partnership Formalization

## The Ask
I'm requesting $50K budget allocation and 0.5 FTE (Riley) for Q1 to formalize the Salesforce Agentforce partnership. This investment positions us for the enterprise AI ecosystem where Salesforce generated $100M in year one bookings.

---

## The Opportunity

### Business Impact
**Direct pipeline**: Three enterprise opportunities ($800K combined) are specifically asking about Salesforce integration. NXP alone is $400K.

**Market access**: AppExchange listing reaches thousands of Salesforce customers. Conservative estimate: 5 qualified leads per quarter at current conversion rates = $500K additional pipeline annually.

**Competitive positioning**: Early partner status in forming ecosystem. Waiting means competing against established partners.

### Strategic Alignment
Directly supports enterprise AI positioning strategy. Validates "open platform" thesis by proving integration with dominant CRM ecosystem.

---

## Investment Required

| Component | Investment | Delivers |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| Partnership fees | $30K | ISV partner status, AppExchange listing |
| Legal review | $10K | Partnership agreements |
| Riley allocation | 0.5 FTE Q1 | Partnership lead, coordination |
| Engineering support | $10K | Partner certification, testing |
| **Total** | **$50K + 0.5 FTE** | |

### Hidden Costs Acknowledged
- Ongoing maintenance: ~$10K/year after launch
- Partner program requirements: Training, certification renewals
- Co-marketing expectations: Some effort required

---

## Risks and Assumptions

### Key Assumptions
- Salesforce partnership program accepts our application (High confidence - validated at Dreamforce)
- Cox lighthouse remains committed (High confidence - POC complete, pilot approved)
- Market demand sustains (Medium confidence - based on early signals, not proven at scale)

### Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Partnership approval delayed | Missed Q1 timing | Begin application immediately |
| Cox lighthouse falls through | Lose proof point | Identify backup (NXP as candidate) |
| Lower demand than expected | Lower ROI | Phase investment, prove before scaling |

### What We Don't Know
- Exact conversion rate from AppExchange leads
- Salesforce co-sell support level we'll receive
- Competitor timing (are others also pursuing?)

---

## The Decision

**Request**: Approve $50K budget and Riley's Q1 allocation for partnership formalization
**Timeline**: Decision needed by Jan 15 to hit February application deadline
**If approved**: Riley initiates partnership application Jan 16, targets February legal close

### Return Timeline
- **Q1**: Partnership active, AppExchange listed
- **Q2**: First partner-sourced deal closed
- **Q2+**: Pipeline impact measurable
- **Leading indicators**: AppExchange views, AE introductions, demo requests
