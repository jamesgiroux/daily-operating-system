# Build-Showcase-Sell Template

A three-pillar GTM framework for new capabilities, partnerships, or market entries.

## When to Use

- New product or capability launch
- Partnership go-to-market strategy
- Market entry planning
- Any initiative that needs to prove value before scaling

## Core Principle

**You can't sell what you can't showcase. You can't showcase what you haven't built.**

This framework enforces sequencing: technical readiness before reference customers before scaled sales. It prevents the common mistake of trying to sell what doesn't yet exist or hasn't been proven.

## The Framework

## Structure

### Introduction (1-2 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: What we're taking to market and why.

**Guidance**:
- Name the capability or initiative
- Explain the market opportunity
- Set up the three-pillar approach
- Show why sequencing matters

**Questions to ask**:
- Is the opportunity clear?
- Is it obvious why we need this sequenced approach?

### BUILD: Technical Foundation (2-3 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: What we're creating and how we know it's ready.

**Guidance**:
- Core capability description
- Technical readiness criteria
- What "done" looks like for BUILD phase
- Dependencies and resources needed

**Exit criteria for BUILD**:
- Technical capability functional
- Integration tested
- Documentation complete
- Support model defined
- Ready for controlled deployment

**Questions to ask**:
- Is the technical scope clear?
- Are readiness criteria specific?
- Would we know when BUILD is done?

### SHOWCASE: Proof Points (2-3 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: How we prove value with early adopters.

**Guidance**:
- Lighthouse customer strategy
- What we need to capture (metrics, quotes, lessons)
- Case study development plan
- Reference customer criteria

**Exit criteria for SHOWCASE**:
- At least one lighthouse customer live
- ROI documented
- Case study ready for use
- Reference calls available
- Key objections addressed with proof

**Questions to ask**:
- Who are our lighthouse targets?
- What proof do we need to capture?
- Would a prospect find this compelling?

### SELL: Scaled GTM (2-3 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: How we take this to the broader market.

**Guidance**:
- Sales enablement approach
- Target segment and ICP
- Pitch and demo standardization
- Pricing model
- Pipeline goals

**Exit criteria for SELL**:
- Sales trained and enabled
- Repeatable demo exists
- Pricing validated
- First non-lighthouse deals closed
- Pipeline generation underway

**Questions to ask**:
- Can sales execute independently?
- Is the market path clear?
- What does success look like?

## Anti-Patterns

- **Selling before building** - Promising what doesn't exist
- **Building without showcase plan** - Technology without GTM
- **Skipping showcase** - Trying to scale unproven value
- **Single lighthouse dependency** - All eggs in one customer
- **Vague exit criteria** - "When it feels ready"

## Framework Questions

Before each phase transition:

**BUILD → SHOWCASE**: Is the technology ready for a real customer to use in production? Could we support them if something goes wrong?

**SHOWCASE → SELL**: Do we have proof that works? Could a sales rep tell this story? Would a prospect find this compelling?

- [ ] Pitch deck and talk track
- [ ] Demo environment and script
- [ ] Objection handling guide
- [ ] Pricing and packaging finalized

## Success Metrics

| Phase | Key Metric | Target |
|-------|-----------|--------|

## Example

The Agentforce partnership follows this framework:

**BUILD**: Connector MVP for Salesforce Data Cloud + Agentforce integration. Exit: Dreamforce demo-ready.

**SHOWCASE**: Cox Automotive as lighthouse. Exit: POC validated, case study material, reference call willing.

**SELL**: Formal Salesforce partnership with co-sell motion. Exit: First non-Cox deal closed through partner channel.
