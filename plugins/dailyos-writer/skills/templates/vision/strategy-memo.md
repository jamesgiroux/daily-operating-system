# Strategy Memo Template

A P2-style memo proposing a strategic direction, initiative, or change. Designed to persuade through structured argument.

## When to Use

- Proposing a new initiative or direction
- Advocating for resource allocation
- Recommending organizational change
- Building consensus around a strategy

## Core Principle

**Make the case, don't just state it.**

A strategy memo isn't a summary—it's a persuasive argument. You're not reporting on a strategy; you're selling it internally.

## Structure

### The Headline (2-3 sentences)

**Purpose**: The proposal in one breath.

**Guidance**:
- Lead with the recommendation, not background
- Make the ask clear
- Include the stakes or opportunity

**Format**: "[What we should do] because [key reason]. This represents [stakes/opportunity]."

**Questions to ask**:
- Is the proposal unmistakably clear?
- Would a reader know what decision you want?
- Are the stakes evident?

### The Situation (2-3 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Establish shared context and build the case for action.

**Guidance**:
- What's happening that makes this relevant?
- What's changed (or about to change)?
- Ground in facts, not assertions
- Create urgency without hype

**Questions to ask**:
- Is this context everyone would agree with?
- Am I creating genuine urgency?
- Are facts cited and verifiable?

### The Proposal (3-4 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: The detailed recommendation.

**Guidance**:
- Specific enough to act on
- Break into components if complex
- Address the "what" and "how"
- Acknowledge what this requires

**Questions to ask**:
- Is this specific enough to implement?
- Have I addressed obvious questions?
- Is the scope clear?

### Why This, Why Now (2-3 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: The argument for this approach.

**Guidance**:
- Why this approach vs. alternatives?
- Why now vs. later (or never)?
- What evidence supports this direction?
- Anticipate and address objections

**Questions to ask**:
- Have I addressed "why not just wait?"
- Are there alternatives I should acknowledge?
- Is my evidence compelling?

### The Ask (1 paragraph + optional next steps)

**Purpose**: Clear request for decision or action.

**Guidance**:
- What specifically do you need?
- Who needs to decide or act?
- What's the timeline?
- Make it easy to say yes

**Questions to ask**:
- Is my ask specific and actionable?
- Have I made the next step obvious?
- Is the timeline realistic?

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Burying the proposal** - Background section longer than the ask
- **Passive recommendations** - "It might be worth considering" vs. "We should"
- **Missing stakes** - Why this matters now not clear
- **No alternatives considered** - Seems like you didn't think it through
- **Vague ask** - "Thoughts welcome" vs. specific decision needed

## Tone Guidance

| Avoid | Prefer |
|-------|--------|
| "I think we should consider..." | "We should..." |
| "This could potentially..." | "This will..." |
| "Feedback welcome" | "I recommend we proceed. Questions?" |
| "Various options exist" | "Three options exist. I recommend Option B." |

## Example

```markdown
# WordPress VIP Should Formalize the Salesforce Partnership in Q1

## The Proposal
We should invest in formalizing our Salesforce partnership before the ecosystem matures. Early movers in the Agentforce partner program get preferential positioning. We have validated technology and a lighthouse customer ready—the risk is in waiting, not acting.

---

## The Situation
Salesforce generated $100M in Agentforce bookings in year one. Their partner ecosystem is actively forming. Three enterprise accounts in our pipeline are specifically asking about Salesforce integration capability.

We demonstrated a working connector at Dreamforce. Cox Automotive is deploying as a lighthouse customer. The technical validation phase is behind us.

The window is now. Salesforce is building their preferred partner list. Waiting six months means competing against entrenched partners rather than establishing as an early mover.

## What We Should Do
Formalize the partnership through Salesforce's ISV partner program with target completion in Q1.

### Partner Program Enrollment
Complete AppExchange listing and ISV partnership paperwork. Riley to lead, with target legal close in February.

### Co-Sell Infrastructure
Establish joint pipeline management with Salesforce AEs. Define shared success metrics and lead routing process.

### Marketing Coordination
Coordinate announcement with Salesforce partnership marketing. Leverage Cox case study as launch proof point.

## Why This Approach
**Why formal partnership vs. ad-hoc deals?**
Current deals require custom coordination on each opportunity. Partnership infrastructure enables repeatable co-sell motion at scale.

**Why now vs. Q2 or later?**
Partner ecosystem forming now. NXP opportunity ($400K) is testing a model we can't scale without partnership infrastructure. Three additional opportunities waiting on partnership clarity.

**Alternative considered**: Continue ad-hoc deals. Rejected because: unsustainable coordination overhead, miss AppExchange distribution, lose to partners who can execute formal co-sell.

---

## The Ask
Approve formal partnership pursuit as Q1 priority. This requires:
- Leadership bandwidth allocation for Riley (partnership lead)
- Legal review capacity for partnership agreements
- Marketing coordination for launch announcement

### Next Steps (if approved)
- **Riley**: Initiate Salesforce partnership application by Jan 15
- **James**: Continue NXP as proof point, support Cox lighthouse positioning
- **Marketing**: Begin case study development with Cox
