# Discussion Outline Template

Structure for a multi-person podcast or panel discussion where multiple voices explore a topic together.

## When to Use

- Co-hosted podcast episodes
- Panel discussions
- Roundtable conversations
- Team retrospectives recorded as content

## Core Principle

**Orchestrate, don't dominate.**

A discussion outline manages the flow so everyone contributes meaningfully. You're creating productive collision between perspectives, not filling airtime.

## Discussion Dynamics

```
Opening → Establish Positions → Explore Tensions → Find Synthesis → Close
```

## Structure

### Pre-Discussion Setup (for facilitator)

**Purpose**: Your preparation for managing the conversation.

**Guidance**:
- Participant list with their angles/perspectives
- What each person uniquely contributes
- Potential points of agreement and disagreement
- Rough time allocations
- Who might need drawing out vs. managing

**Questions to ask**:
- Do I understand each participant's likely perspective?
- Where will the interesting friction be?
- Who might dominate? Who might need prompting?

### Opening (3-5 minutes)

**Purpose**: Frame the discussion and introduce voices.

**Guidance**:
- Brief topic introduction
- Why this matters now
- Quick participant intros (or have them introduce themselves)
- Set up the central question

**Format**: "Today we're exploring [topic] with [participants]. The question on the table: [central question]. Let's start with [first person], what's your take?"

### Position Mapping (5-10 minutes)

**Purpose**: Get each perspective on the table.

**Guidance**:
- Each participant states their initial view
- Keep it quick—depth comes later
- Note areas of agreement and disagreement
- Create the landscape before exploring

**Facilitator moves**:
- "Let's hear from each of you briefly. [Name], where do you stand on this?"
- "Before we dig in, what's your initial take?"
- "[Name], I notice you seemed to react to that. What's your view?"

**Questions to ask**:
- Have all voices been heard?
- Is the disagreement/tension clear?
- Are there surprising areas of agreement?

### Exploration (15-25 minutes)

**Purpose**: The substantive discussion where ideas collide.

**Guidance**:
- Probe the tensions identified in position mapping
- Encourage direct response between participants
- Ask follow-ups that create productive collision
- Manage airtime so no one dominates

**Facilitator moves**:
- "[Name], you disagree. Tell [other name] why."
- "What's underneath that disagreement?"
- "Where do you two actually agree?"
- "[Name], you've been quiet—what's your take?"
- "Let me push back on that. What about..."
- "That's interesting. [Other name], does that change your view?"

**Questions to ask**:
- Is this productive tension or just argument?
- Are we going deep enough on the interesting points?
- Is everyone getting airtime?

### Synthesis (5-8 minutes)

**Purpose**: What did we learn from this collision of ideas?

**Guidance**:
- Pull together the threads
- Identify where views shifted (or didn't)
- Name what's still unresolved
- Look for unexpected common ground

**Facilitator moves**:
- "What did you hear from [other participant] that surprised you?"
- "Where have your views shifted, if at all?"
- "What are we agreeing on that we didn't expect?"
- "What remains unresolved?"

### Close (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Land with value for the audience.

**Guidance**:
- Quick takeaway from each participant
- Frame what the audience should do with this
- Thank participants
- Clear ending

**Closing question**: "In one sentence, what should our listeners take away from this?"

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Facilitator lecture** - Talking more than participants
- **Turn-taking** - Rigid rotation instead of natural conversation
- **Surface disagreement** - Not probing why they disagree
- **Runaway participant** - One voice dominating
- **Forced consensus** - Pretending agreement exists when it doesn't

## Managing Discussion Dynamics

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| One person dominating | "Let me pause you there—[Name], respond to that" |
| Someone too quiet | "I'm curious what [Name] thinks about this" |
| Disagreement getting heated | "Let's make sure we understand each other. [Name], summarize [other]'s position" |
| Going off topic | "That's interesting—let's come back to it. For now, [redirect]" |
| Violent agreement | "You're agreeing—let me challenge that. What about [counter-view]?" |

## Template

```markdown
# [Show Name]: [Topic] Discussion Outline

## Participants & Angles
- **[Name 1]**: [Their likely perspective/expertise]
- **[Name 2]**: [Their likely perspective/expertise]
- **[Name 3]**: [Their likely perspective/expertise] (if applicable)

**Expected tensions**: [Where they'll disagree]
**Common ground**: [Where they'll likely agree]

---

## Opening (3-5 min)
[How you'll frame the topic and central question]

**Central question**: [The question we're exploring]

---

## Position Mapping (5-10 min)

**Prompt for each**: "[Name], give us your 1-minute take on [central question]"

**Expected positions**:
- [Name 1]: Likely to argue [X]
- [Name 2]: Likely to argue [Y]
- [Name 3]: Likely to argue [Z]

---

## Exploration (15-25 min)

### Tension 1: [Topic]
**Opening prompt**: [Question that surfaces disagreement]
**Follow-up**: [Dig deeper]
**Cross-response**: "[Name], respond to that"

### Tension 2: [Topic]
**Opening prompt**: [Question]
**Follow-up**: [Dig deeper]
**Bridge to synthesis**: [How to wrap this thread]

### Surprise/flexibility (optional)
[Leave room to pursue unexpected directions]

---

## Synthesis (5-8 min)
- "What surprised you in this conversation?"
- "Where have you shifted, if at all?"
- "What remains unresolved?"

---

## Close (2-3 min)
**One-sentence takeaway** from each participant
**Audience frame**: "If you're thinking about this, here's what to consider..."
**Thanks and sign-off**
```

---

## Example

**Topic**: "Should TAMs specialize by industry or capability?"

**Participants**:
- Amy (favors industry specialization)
- Riley (favors capability specialization)
- James (sees hybrid approach)

**Central question**: "What should determine how we organize TAM expertise?"

**Expected tensions**: Industry depth vs. transferable skills; customer segmentation vs. internal efficiency

**Exploration**: Probe real examples where specialization helped or hurt. Challenge each position with counter-examples. Push on "what would have to be true for the other view to be right?"
