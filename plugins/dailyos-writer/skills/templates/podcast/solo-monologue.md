# Solo Monologue Template

Structure for a single-host episode where you're developing an idea, sharing an opinion, or exploring a topic on your own.

## When to Use

- Solo podcast episodes
- Voice-over scripts for video
- Audio essays
- Commentary pieces

## Core Principle

**Conversation with the listener.**

A monologue isn't a lecture. You're thinking out loud with the listener, taking them on a journey. They should feel engaged, not talked at.

## Solo Episode Dynamics

The challenge of solo content is maintaining energy and engagement without a conversation partner. Structure becomes your conversation partner.

**Tools for engagement**:
- Direct address ("You might be thinking...")
- Questions you answer ("So what does this mean? Let me tell you.")
- Asides and tangents (brief, relevant)
- Self-interruption ("Actually, wait—there's something more important here")
- Story and example (breaks up abstract sections)

## Structure

### The Hook (30-60 seconds)

**Purpose**: Grab attention and create curiosity.

**Guidance**:
- Start with energy—you're creating the mood
- A question, a provocative statement, or a story opening
- Don't meander—earn their attention immediately
- Preview what's coming without giving it all away

**Patterns that work**:
- "Here's what nobody tells you about [topic]..."
- "I made a mistake recently. And I learned something from it."
- "Let me ask you a question: [provocative question]"
- "[Surprising statement]. That sounds wrong, doesn't it? Let me explain."

**Questions to ask**:
- Would I keep listening if someone else said this?
- Is there energy in my opening?
- Have I created a reason to stay?

### The Setup (2-4 minutes)

**Purpose**: Build context and frame the exploration.

**Guidance**:
- What are we talking about and why now?
- What do I want the listener to understand?
- Set up the tension or question we'll resolve
- Keep it efficient—this isn't the destination

**Questions to ask**:
- Is the context necessary or just throat-clearing?
- Have I created a question that needs answering?
- Does the listener know why this matters to them?

### The Core (10-15 minutes)

**Purpose**: The substantive development of your idea.

**Guidance**:
- Break into 2-4 distinct movements
- Each movement: point → support → transition
- Mix abstract and concrete (theory → example → theory → example)
- Use signposting to help listeners track

**Signposting phrases**:
- "First... Second... Third..." (use sparingly)
- "Here's where it gets interesting..."
- "Now, you might be thinking [objection]. Let me address that."
- "But here's what most people miss..."
- "Let me give you an example of what I mean."

**Questions to ask**:
- Am I varying my pace and energy?
- Are there enough concrete examples?
- Would a listener know where we are in the argument?

### The Turn (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: The insight or conclusion that makes this worth listening to.

**Guidance**:
- This is your "aha" moment
- It should feel earned by what came before
- Land it clearly—don't bury your best insight
- Give it room to breathe

**Patterns for landing insight**:
- "So here's what I've come to believe..."
- "This is the thing I wish I'd understood earlier..."
- "The real insight isn't [obvious thing]. It's [actual insight]."
- Pause. Let it sit. Then continue.

**Questions to ask**:
- Is my main insight clear?
- Have I given it enough emphasis?
- Would someone quote this part?

### The Close (1-2 minutes)

**Purpose**: Land the plane and leave them thinking.

**Guidance**:
- Bring it back to them (application, reflection)
- Don't just summarize—add value
- End with energy, not fade
- Could be a callback to the opening, a question, or a memorable line

**Closing patterns**:
- "So here's what I want you to do: [actionable thing]"
- "The question to ask yourself: [reflection prompt]"
- "That's what I've got. [Memorable closing line]"
- "[Callback to opening story/question]. Now you know why."

**Questions to ask**:
- Am I ending with energy, not fading?
- Is there something for them to do or think about?
- Would they remember this ending?

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Lecture voice** - Talking at rather than with
- **Energy drop** - Starting strong, fading in the middle
- **Endless examples** - Proving the same point three times
- **No signposting** - Listener gets lost
- **Apologizing** - "This might be obvious but..." (don't undermine yourself)

## Energy Management

Solo content requires managing your own energy:
- **Mark energy shifts in your outline** [HIGH ENERGY] [REFLECTIVE] [BUILDING]
- **Plan your peaks** - Where do you want highest intensity?
- **Use variety** - Fast section → slow section → fast section
- **Record standing** - Physical energy affects vocal energy

## Example

**Episode**: "Why Proactive Outreach Feels So Hard (And What to Do About It)"

**Hook**: "You know you should reach out to that customer. The one who's been quiet. You've been meaning to for three weeks. Why haven't you done it? I'll tell you exactly why."

**Setup**: The gap between knowing what to do and actually doing it. Why proactive work loses to reactive work every time.

**Core movements**:
1. The psychology of reactive vs. proactive (why urgent feels more real than important)
2. The hidden cost of not reaching out (compound decay)
3. What actually works (specific tactics that reduce friction)

**Turn**: "The customers who churned almost never had a crisis. They had silence. And we let the silence compound."

**Close**: "Before this episode ends, send one message to one customer you haven't reached out to in a month. Just one. Make proactive the default."
