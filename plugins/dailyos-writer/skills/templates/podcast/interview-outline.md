# Interview Outline Template

Structure for a podcast or video interview with a guest. Designed to create good conversation flow while ensuring key topics are covered.

## When to Use

- Interviewing a subject matter expert
- Customer or partner conversations for content
- Internal interviews for case studies
- Any Q&A format content

## Core Principle

**Great questions create space for great answers.**

An interview outline isn't a script—it's a conversational scaffolding. You're creating openings for the guest to shine, not cornering them into your predetermined points.

## Interview Structure

```
Opening → Warmup → Core Thread(s) → Lightning Round (optional) → Close
```

## Structure

### Pre-Interview Context (for you, not on air)

**Purpose**: Your preparation notes.

**Guidance**:
- Guest background (1-2 paragraphs)
- Why they're interesting for this topic
- What you want them to talk about
- Topics to avoid (if any)
- Connection points for rapport

**Questions to ask**:
- Do I understand their perspective?
- What's unique about what they can offer?
- What would my audience want to hear from them?

### Opening (1-2 minutes)

**Purpose**: Set up the guest and topic.

**Guidance**:
- Brief guest introduction
- Why this conversation now
- What the audience will get
- Create anticipation

**Format**: "Today I'm talking with [Guest] about [Topic]. [Why this matters]. Let's dive in."

### Warmup Question (3-5 minutes)

**Purpose**: Get the guest comfortable and talking.

**Guidance**:
- Easy entry point they'll enjoy answering
- Often backstory or "how did you get into this"
- Creates context for what follows
- Shows the guest you're interested in them, not just the topic

**Good warmup patterns**:
- "Tell us about [relevant background]"
- "How did you first get interested in [topic]?"
- "What's your role, and how did you end up here?"

**Questions to ask**:
- Will they enjoy answering this?
- Does this create useful context?
- Is this too generic or personal enough?

### Core Thread(s) (15-30 minutes)

**Purpose**: The substantive exploration.

**Guidance**:
- 2-3 main threads, not 10 topics
- Each thread: opening question → follow-ups → transition
- Listen and follow unexpected directions
- Use "tell me more about..." as your friend
- Have follow-up questions ready but be willing to diverge

**Thread structure**:
- **Opening question**: Broad entry point
- **Depth questions**: Dig into interesting responses
- **Challenge questions**: Test or push back respectfully
- **Example requests**: "Can you give me an example?"
- **Transition**: Bridge to next thread

**Question types to mix**:
- Experience: "Tell me about a time when..."
- Opinion: "What do you think about..."
- Hypothetical: "If you could change one thing..."
- Advice: "What would you tell someone who..."
- Contrast: "How is this different from..."

**Questions to ask**:
- Am I exploring, not interrogating?
- Is there room for them to surprise me?
- Have I earned the right to ask harder questions?

### Lightning Round (optional, 3-5 minutes)

**Purpose**: Quick, fun, memorable moments.

**Guidance**:
- Shorter, punchier questions
- Reveals personality
- Creates shareable clips
- Change of pace before closing

**Examples**:
- "Best advice you ever received?"
- "Biggest misconception about [their field]?"
- "One thing you wish you'd learned earlier?"

### Close (2-3 minutes)

**Purpose**: Land the plane gracefully.

**Guidance**:
- Opportunity for their parting wisdom
- Where to find them / what they're working on
- Thank them genuinely
- Clear ending

**Closing question patterns**:
- "What's one thing you want listeners to take away?"
- "Where can people find you / learn more?"
- "What are you excited about right now?"

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Script dependence** - Reading questions vs. having a conversation
- **Interrupting** - Cutting off good answers
- **Leading questions** - "Don't you think that..."
- **Topic whiplash** - Jumping randomly between subjects
- **Guest pitching** - Letting it become a commercial

## Active Listening Moves

Build these into your conversation:
- "Tell me more about that..."
- "What do you mean by [term they used]?"
- "That's interesting—how did you figure that out?"
- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "What happened next?"

## Example

See `Projects/Video-Content/` for examples of interview structures used in thought leadership video content.

Key patterns:
- Warmup creates rapport before substantive questions
- 2-3 threads go deep rather than 10 topics going shallow
- Follow-ups respond to what they actually said
- Lightning round creates clips
