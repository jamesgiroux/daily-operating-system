# Framework Introduction Template

Introduce an established framework (SCQA, JTBD, Pyramid Principle, etc.) to an audience who hasn't encountered it, translating it for their specific context.

## When to Use

- You're teaching a borrowed framework, not inventing one
- Your audience would benefit from this thinking tool
- You can translate abstract concepts to their specific work
- The framework solves a real problem they face

## Core Principle

**The value is in translation, not invention.**

You're not claiming this framework as your own. You're the guide who makes it accessible to your specific audience. Give credit, show applications, and demonstrate mastery through clear explanation.

## Structure

### The Problem It Solves (2-3 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Ground the framework in a problem your audience recognizes.

**Guidance**:
- Start with a pain point, not the framework
- Make them nod in recognition
- Create the "yes, I struggle with that" moment
- Don't mention the framework yet

**Questions to ask**:
- Will my reader recognize this problem?
- Is this specific enough to feel real?
- Am I creating genuine need for a solution?

### The Framework Origin (1-2 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Introduce the framework with proper attribution and context.

**Guidance**:
- Name the source (McKinsey, Barbara Minto, Christensen, etc.)
- Brief context on why it was developed
- Establish credibility through lineage
- Keep it brief—this isn't a history lesson

**Questions to ask**:
- Have I properly attributed this?
- Is the origin story relevant or just filler?
- Does this build credibility?

### The Core Concept (3-4 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Explain the framework clearly and simply.

**Guidance**:
- Explain it simply enough for a newcomer
- Use your audience's language, not consultant jargon
- One concept at a time
- Build understanding progressively

**Questions to ask**:
- Could someone new to this actually learn it?
- Am I being clear, not clever?
- Is each piece necessary?

### In Your Context (3-4 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Translate the framework to your audience's specific work.

**Guidance**:
- Use examples from their world
- Show how the abstract applies to concrete situations
- Address the "but my work is different" objection
- Make it feel relevant, not academic

**Questions to ask**:
- Are my examples from their context?
- Would they see themselves in this?
- Am I making it practical?

### How to Apply It (2-3 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Give them concrete steps to use this immediately.

**Guidance**:
- Specific actions they can take tomorrow
- A scenario or two showing application
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Make it feel achievable

**Questions to ask**:
- Can they actually do this tomorrow?
- Have I made the first step easy?
- Are there pitfalls I should warn about?

### When Not to Use It (1 paragraph)

**Purpose**: Boundaries and limitations.

**Guidance**:
- When is this the wrong tool?
- What problems does it not solve?
- Builds credibility through honesty

**Questions to ask**:
- Am I being honest about limitations?
- Will this prevent misapplication?

## Anti-Patterns

- **Pretending you invented it** - Give credit to sources
- **Jargon dumping** - Use their language, not consultant-speak
- **Abstract without concrete** - Every concept needs an example
- **No application** - If they can't use it, why teach it?
- **Over-complicating** - The best explanations are simple

## Example

**Title**: "SCQA: The Structure Behind Every Compelling Business Argument"

**Problem it solves**: You have good analysis but struggle to structure it so executives actually act on it.

**Origin**: McKinsey. Developed for structuring strategic communications that drive decisions.

**Core concept**: Situation (what everyone agrees on) → Complication (what changed or went wrong) → Question (the natural question that arises) → Answer (your recommendation).

**In TAM context**: When you're proposing an expansion, don't start with features. Start with their situation, the complication they're facing, the question that creates, and your recommended answer.

**How to apply**: Before your next exec email, map S-C-Q-A in bullet points first. Then write prose around that structure.

**When not to use**: Quick status updates, relationship-building conversations, situations where you don't have a clear recommendation.
