# Hook → Problem → Reframe Template

The standard thought leadership arc. Best for introducing a new perspective on a problem your audience already recognizes.

## When to Use

- Reader knows the problem but not your angle on it
- You have a genuinely counterintuitive insight
- You want to sit in discomfort before offering solutions
- The payoff is a shift in how they see the issue

## Structure

### The Hook (2-3 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Draw them in. Create recognition or curiosity.

**Guidance**:
- Start with a scenario they recognize
- Or open with a question they've asked themselves
- Create that "yes, I know exactly what you mean" feeling
- Don't give away the insight yet

**Questions to ask**:
- Would my target reader nod in recognition?
- Is there enough specificity to feel real?
- Am I creating curiosity about what comes next?

### The Problem (3-4 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Name the thing clearly. Sit in it.

**Guidance**:
- Don't rush to solve
- Let the discomfort build
- Be specific about what makes this hard
- Acknowledge the real frustration

**Questions to ask**:
- Am I sitting in this long enough?
- Have I named what's actually hard, not just the surface symptoms?
- Would my reader feel understood?

### The Diagnosis (3-4 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Why does this happen? What's underneath?

**Guidance**:
- This is where your insight lives
- What do most people miss?
- What's the real cause, not the obvious one?
- Build toward the reframe

**Questions to ask**:
- Am I explaining why, not just what?
- Is this analysis non-obvious?
- Does this set up the reframe naturally?

### The Reframe (2-3 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: The turn. The new way of seeing.

**Guidance**:
- This should feel like relief after the problem
- "Oh, that's what's really going on"
- The insight that changes everything
- Must be genuinely counterintuitive

**Questions to ask**:
- Is this actually counterintuitive?
- Could someone disagree with this?
- Does it feel like a genuine "aha"?

### The Practice (3-4 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: What do you actually do?

**Guidance**:
- Concrete actions, not vague principles
- Questions to ask themselves
- Frameworks to apply
- Make it actionable for tomorrow

**Questions to ask**:
- Can someone do this tomorrow?
- Is this specific enough to act on?
- Does it flow from the reframe?

### The Payoff (2-3 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: What changes when you get this right?

**Guidance**:
- Paint the picture of success
- Make it feel achievable
- Connect back to the original problem
- Show the transformation is possible

**Questions to ask**:
- Is this compelling?
- Does it feel realistic?
- Does it complete the arc from the problem?

### The Close (1 paragraph)

**Purpose**: Land it.

**Guidance**:
- Memorable line
- Could be callback to hook
- Could be new provocation
- Leave them thinking

**Questions to ask**:
- Would someone quote this?
- Does it stick?

## Anti-Patterns

- **Rushing through the problem section** - If you solve too fast, the reframe doesn't land
- **Obvious reframe** - If everyone already thinks this way, there's no insight
- **Abstract practice** - "Be more strategic" isn't actionable
- **Preachy tone** - Share observations, don't lecture

## Examples

Good articles using this structure:
- "The Not-Doing List" (Week 1 Leadership Content)
- "Jobs To Be Done" (Week 2 Leadership Content)
