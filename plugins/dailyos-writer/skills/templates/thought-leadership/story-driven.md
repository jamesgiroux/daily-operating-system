# Story-Driven Template

Use a compelling personal story as the spine of the piece, with lessons woven throughout rather than stated at the end.

## When to Use

- You have a strong personal story that embodies your point
- The lesson is best shown, not told
- Your experience illuminates something universal
- You want emotional resonance alongside intellectual insight

## Core Principle

**The story proves the point.**

This isn't "let me tell you a story, and then here's the lesson." The lesson emerges through the story itself. The reader discovers it alongside you.

## Structure

### The Hook (1-2 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Drop them into the story at a moment of tension.

**Guidance**:
- Start in the middle of something happening
- Create immediate questions: What happened? Why does this matter?
- Use specific, sensory details
- Don't explain yet—let them wonder

**Questions to ask**:
- Is there tension or mystery?
- Are the details specific enough to feel real?
- Would someone want to keep reading?

### The Story (5-7 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Tell the story with embedded lessons.

**Guidance**:
- Let the narrative unfold naturally
- Weave in observations as you go (not saved for the end)
- Include moments of doubt, failure, or surprise
- Show your thinking at key decision points
- Make the reader feel they're there with you

**The embedded lesson technique**:
Instead of: "I did X. [Later] The lesson is Y."
Use: "I did X. What I didn't realize then was Y." or "Looking back, the thing I almost missed was Y."

**Questions to ask**:
- Is the lesson emerging through the story?
- Are there real moments of tension or uncertainty?
- Am I showing my thinking, not just actions?

### The Turn (1-2 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: The moment of realization or change.

**Guidance**:
- This is where the insight crystallizes
- Something shifts in your understanding
- The reader should feel the "aha" with you
- Don't rush this moment

**Questions to ask**:
- Is the turn clearly marked?
- Does it feel earned by what came before?
- Will the reader have their own "aha"?

### The Universal (2-3 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Connect your specific story to their general experience.

**Guidance**:
- Move from "I" to "we" or "you"
- Show how this applies beyond your situation
- Acknowledge that contexts differ
- Make it relevant to the reader

**Questions to ask**:
- Have I bridged from my story to their world?
- Is the universal insight clear without being preachy?
- Does this feel like shared discovery?

### The Application (1-2 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Give them something to do with this.

**Guidance**:
- Light touch—not a 5-step framework
- A question to ask themselves
- A way to notice this in their own experience
- Keep it organic to the narrative flow

**Questions to ask**:
- Does this flow naturally from the story?
- Is it actionable without being prescriptive?
- Have I avoided sudden "how-to" voice shift?

## Anti-Patterns

- **Hero narrative** - Where you always win and look good
- **Lesson dump at the end** - "And the moral of the story is..."
- **Vague details** - "A client once said..." (which client? when? what exactly?)
- **False humility** - Pretending you learned something you already knew
- **Preaching** - Using the story as excuse to lecture

## The Embedded Lesson Technique

**Instead of**:
> I walked into the meeting unprepared. [Story continues] [End of story] The lesson here is that preparation matters.

**Use**:
> I walked into the meeting unprepared—I'd convinced myself that winging it was "being authentic." What I didn't understand yet was that preparation IS authenticity. You prepare because you respect the other person's time.

The lesson lives inside the story, not after it.

## Template

```markdown
# [Title - Often a Fragment or Question from the Story]

[1-2 paragraphs: Drop into the moment. Tension, sensory details, questions raised.]

---

[5-7 paragraphs: The story unfolds. Lessons woven in as observations, realizations, hindsight.]

[1-2 paragraphs: The turn. The moment of realization. The shift.]

---

## What This Means for [Broader Context]

[2-3 paragraphs: Connect to universal experience. From "I" to "we/you".]

[1-2 paragraphs: Light application. A question to consider. A way to notice this.]
```

## Example

**Title**: "The Silence Before the No"

**Hook**: "Thirty seconds of silence. I'm watching the VP's face, and I can't read it. Everything I prepared—the deck, the business case, the ROI numbers—suddenly feels irrelevant."

**Story**: Narrative of a customer meeting that went sideways. Embedded lessons about how we often prepare for the conversation we want to have, not the one that's actually happening. The turn: realizing the VP wasn't evaluating my proposal—she was testing whether I understood her actual problem.

**Universal**: We all prepare presentations as if the slides are the point. But the meeting is never about the slides. It's about whether you understand what they're really trying to solve.

**Application**: Before your next high-stakes meeting, ask yourself: "What question is this person actually trying to answer for themselves?"
