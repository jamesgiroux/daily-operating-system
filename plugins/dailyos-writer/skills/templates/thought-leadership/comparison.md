# Comparison Template

Present two ways of thinking about or approaching something, then advocate for one based on evidence and reasoning.

## When to Use

- There are genuinely two valid approaches (not a straw-man)
- You have a clear position on which is better
- The reader may be using the less effective approach
- The contrast illuminates something non-obvious

## Core Principle

**Fair comparison, earned advocacy.**

You're not setting up a straw-man to knock down. Both approaches have genuine appeal. Your job is to show—through evidence and reasoning—why one serves your audience better.

## Structure

### The Choice (1-2 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Frame the two approaches and why this matters.

**Guidance**:
- Name the two approaches clearly
- Show why people might choose either
- Establish stakes—why this choice matters
- Don't reveal your position yet

**Questions to ask**:
- Are both options genuinely viable?
- Is the framing fair to both?
- Is it clear why this choice matters?

### Approach A: Deep Dive (3-4 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Explore the first approach thoroughly and fairly.

**Guidance**:
- Explain it as a proponent would
- Show its strengths and when it works
- Include real examples
- Acknowledge legitimate benefits

**Questions to ask**:
- Would someone who uses this approach feel understood?
- Have I shown the genuine appeal?
- Am I being fair, not setting up a straw-man?

### Approach B: Deep Dive (3-4 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Explore the second approach with equal rigor.

**Guidance**:
- Same depth and fairness as Approach A
- Show its strengths and when it works
- Include real examples
- Acknowledge legitimate benefits

**Questions to ask**:
- Is this given equal weight?
- Would a proponent feel represented?
- Is the comparison balanced so far?

### The Verdict (2-3 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Make your case for which approach is better.

**Guidance**:
- Now state your position clearly
- Base it on evidence, not just preference
- Acknowledge what you're giving up
- Explain for whom and in what context

**Questions to ask**:
- Is my reasoning clear?
- Have I explained for whom this is better?
- Am I honest about trade-offs?

### The Synthesis (1-2 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Nuance and integration.

**Guidance**:
- When might the other approach be right?
- Can elements be combined?
- What's the meta-lesson about making such choices?
- Leave room for reader judgment

**Questions to ask**:
- Am I acknowledging complexity?
- Have I avoided false absolutism?
- Does this feel like wisdom, not dogma?

## Anti-Patterns

- **Straw-manning** - Making one option obviously inferior
- **False balance** - Pretending you don't have a view when you do
- **No verdict** - Comparison without conclusion
- **Ignoring context** - "X is always better" without nuance
- **Superiority posture** - "Smart people choose X"

## The Fairness Test

Before publishing, ask:
1. Would a genuine advocate of each approach feel fairly represented?
2. If someone chooses the approach I didn't advocate, would they have defensible reasons?
3. Have I acknowledged what I'm giving up with my choice?

## Example

**Title**: "Reactive vs. Proactive TAM: Which Actually Drives Retention?"

**The Choice**: You can run your book reactively (respond to issues as they arise) or proactively (anticipate problems before they surface). Both have genuine advocates.

**Approach A: Reactive**
- You're responsive, not intrusive
- Customers know you're there when needed
- Less overhead, more efficient
- Works well for stable, self-sufficient customers
- Example: "My Foundation ring accounts just want someone available if something breaks"

**Approach B: Proactive**
- You catch problems before they become crises
- You demonstrate strategic value, not just operational
- Creates expansion opportunities through deeper understanding
- Example: "I saw the pattern in their usage before they did"

**The Verdict**: For accounts where you want to drive NRR (not just defend GRR), proactive wins—but only if you have genuine insight to offer, not just "checking in."

**Synthesis**: The real answer is calibrated intensity. Foundation ring accounts might need mostly reactive with quarterly proactive touchpoints. Summit ring accounts need sustained proactive engagement. The mistake is applying one approach to all accounts.
