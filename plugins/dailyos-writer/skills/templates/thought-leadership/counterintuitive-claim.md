# Counterintuitive Claim Template

Lead with a provocative thesis that challenges what your audience believes, then earn that position through evidence and reasoning.

## When to Use

- You have a genuinely contrarian view
- The conventional wisdom is wrong (and you can prove it)
- You want to shift how people think about something
- The "everyone knows X" is actually harmful

## Core Principle

**The claim must be earned, not just asserted.**

You're not being contrarian for attention. You're showing why the common view fails and offering something better. The reader should finish thinking "I never thought of it that way, but now I can't unsee it."

## Structure

### The Provocative Opening (1-2 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: State the counterintuitive claim clearly and boldly.

**Guidance**:
- Don't bury the lede
- Make the reader slightly uncomfortable
- Create the "wait, what?" reaction
- Be specific, not vague provocation

**Questions to ask**:
- Is this genuinely surprising to my audience?
- Am I being specific enough that someone could disagree?
- Would this make someone stop scrolling?

### The Conventional Wisdom (2-3 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Acknowledge what most people believe (and why they believe it).

**Guidance**:
- Steel-man the opposing view
- Show you understand why people think this way
- Don't straw-man or dismiss
- Build credibility by being fair

**Questions to ask**:
- Have I stated this as well as a believer would?
- Am I being fair to this position?
- Does this feel like genuine understanding?

### Why It Fails (3-4 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Show where the conventional wisdom breaks down.

**Guidance**:
- Use specific examples, not abstractions
- Show the consequences of following the common view
- Identify the hidden assumptions that are wrong
- Build the case methodically

**Questions to ask**:
- Is this evidence concrete?
- Would a skeptic be convinced?
- Am I attacking the strongest version of the argument?

### The Better Way (3-4 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Present your alternative with supporting evidence.

**Guidance**:
- Not just "do the opposite"
- Show how this actually works
- Provide examples of success
- Make it actionable

**Questions to ask**:
- Is this genuinely better, not just different?
- Do I have evidence it works?
- Can someone apply this?

### The Honest Caveats (1-2 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Acknowledge limitations and edge cases.

**Guidance**:
- Where doesn't this apply?
- What are the risks of your approach?
- When is the conventional wisdom actually right?
- Builds credibility through honesty

**Questions to ask**:
- Am I being honest about limitations?
- Does this prevent misapplication?
- Does this strengthen my credibility?

## Anti-Patterns

- **Contrarian for clicks** - Provocation without substance
- **Straw-manning** - Making the conventional view easier to attack
- **Absolute claims** - "Always" and "never" rarely hold
- **No practical path** - Critique without alternative
- **Arrogance** - "Everyone is wrong and I figured it out"

## Example

A counterintuitive claim for TAMs might be:

**Title**: "Stop Building Relationships With Your Customers"

**Claim**: The best TAMs don't focus on relationships—they focus on making their stakeholders look good to their bosses.

**Conventional wisdom**: "TAM success is about building strong relationships with customers."

**Why it fails**: Relationships don't save accounts when budget cuts come. Stakeholders don't fight for vendors they like—they fight for vendors that make them successful.

**The better way**: Map what your champion's boss cares about. Align every interaction to helping them win internally.

**Caveats**: This doesn't mean be transactional. Genuine care matters. But care expressed through making them successful beats care expressed through being likeable.
