# Monthly Rollup Template

Aggregate weekly impacts into a coherent monthly narrative that tells the story of your contribution.

## When to Use

- End of month impact summary
- Manager updates
- Self-documentation for reviews
- Portfolio health snapshots

## Core Principle

**Outcomes over activities.**

Don't list what you did—show what changed because of what you did. Transform task completion into impact narrative.

## Structure

### Month Headline (1-2 sentences)

**Purpose**: The month in one breath.

**Guidance**:
- Lead with the biggest outcome
- Include quantifiable impact where possible
- Set the narrative frame for what follows

**Format options**:
- "[Month] was defined by [biggest theme/outcome]"
- "Three significant outcomes this month: [X], [Y], [Z]"
- "[Key metric] improved by [amount] through [main activities]"

**Questions to ask**:
- Would my manager get the point from this alone?
- Am I leading with impact, not activity?
- Is this specific enough to be meaningful?

### Impact Highlights (3-5 bullets with detail)

**Purpose**: The key wins with enough context to understand significance.

**Guidance**:
- One major impact per bullet
- Include the "so what"—why does this matter?
- Quantify where possible
- Link to strategic priorities where relevant

**Bullet structure**:
- **Impact statement**: [What changed]
- **How**: [Brief on what you did]
- **So what**: [Why it matters]

**Questions to ask**:
- Are these outcomes, not just activities?
- Would someone outside my context understand the significance?
- Am I being appropriately specific?

### Themes & Patterns (2-3 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: What the individual wins add up to.

**Guidance**:
- Step back from individual events
- What patterns emerged?
- What's developing across the portfolio?
- What should leadership know about trends?

**Pattern categories**:
- Customer behavior shifts
- Market/competitive dynamics
- Product or platform trends
- Team or process learnings

**Questions to ask**:
- Am I synthesizing, not just summarizing?
- Is there insight here beyond the individual wins?
- Would this be valuable for broader team visibility?

### Looking Ahead (1 paragraph)

**Purpose**: Set up next month.

**Guidance**:
- Key priorities for coming month
- What's at risk that needs attention
- What opportunities are emerging
- Set expectations appropriately

**Questions to ask**:
- Are my priorities clear?
- Am I flagging risks early?
- Is this actionable for planning?

## Anti-Patterns

- **Activity laundry list** - "Had 47 meetings" vs. outcomes from those meetings
- **Underselling** - Passive voice hiding your contribution
- **No synthesis** - Just weekly summaries concatenated
- **Missing "so what"** - Impact without significance
- **Vague claims** - "Made good progress" vs. specific progress

## Transformation Examples

| Activity | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| "Had weekly calls with Cox" | "Cox approved Agentforce pilot expansion (50 dealers, Feb launch)" |
| "Worked on renewal prep" | "Hilton renewal secured ($450K, 2-year term) with 15% uplift" |
| "Attended Agentforce meetings" | "Defined co-sell motion with Salesforce for Q1 pipeline" |
| "Responded to support escalations" | "Zero revenue-impacting issues across Summit accounts" |

## Example

```markdown
# October 2025 Impact Summary

## The Month in Brief
Dreamforce validated the Agentforce strategy with live customer demo and three enterprise leads generated. Meanwhile, Foundation ring accounts stabilized with zero escalations.

---

## Impact Highlights

### Agentforce Launched Successfully at Dreamforce
Led live demo at Dreamforce booth with Cox Automotive use case. Generated immediate interest from three enterprise prospects (NXP, Broadcom, ServiceNow). Partnership positioning with Salesforce team confirmed for Q1 formalization.

### Cox Automotive POC Moved to Production-Ready
POC environment validated all core use cases. 60% reduction in dealer inquiry time demonstrated. Cox committed to February pilot with 50 dealers and identified internal budget sponsor.

### Foundation Ring Health Improved
Implemented proactive quarterly touchpoint model for 26 Foundation accounts. Zero escalations in October (down from 3 in September). Early warning indicators now tracked for all accounts.

### Hilton Renewal Closed with Expansion
Two-year renewal closed at $450K (15% uplift from previous term). Added newsroom BU to contract. Executive sponsor relationship strengthened through strategic review process.

---

## Themes & Patterns

Agentforce is creating new conversation opportunities with Salesforce-invested accounts. Three of my top expansion targets (NXP, Broadcom, Cox) are engaging specifically because of AI capabilities. This validates the strategic bet and suggests we should probe Salesforce investment early in account discovery.

Foundation ring proactive model is working. The shift from reactive to quarterly proactive touchpoints reduced noise (fewer surprise escalations) and is creating early expansion signals in accounts we'd previously ignored.

## Looking Ahead: November

Key priorities: Close NXP opportunity ($400K), prepare Cox for pilot kickoff, complete Q4 renewals for Intuit and Salesforce BUs.

Risk to watch: Broadcom stakeholder change—new VP of Digital starting, need to rebuild relationship.

Opportunity: NADA Conference (January) could be significant for Cox visibility if pilot goes well.
