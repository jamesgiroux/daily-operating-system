# Weekly Impact Template

Outcome-focused weekly summary. Emphasizes impact over activity.

## When to Use

- End of week captures
- Manager updates
- Personal tracking for reviews
- Building evidence for quarterly assessments

## Core Principle

**Outcomes over activities**. Not "what I did" but "what resulted."

| Activity (Avoid) | Outcome (Prefer) |
|------------------|------------------|
| Had meeting with Salesforce | Partnership advanced to legal review |
| Worked on Cox account | Cox NADA project greenlit ($150K opportunity) |
| Made progress on Agentforce | MVP scope finalized, on track for Feb launch |

## Structure

### Key Wins (3-5 items)

**Purpose**: Top outcomes for the week.

**Guidance**:
- Lead with biggest impact
- Quantify where possible
- Link to strategic priorities
- Be specific (names, numbers, dates)

**Format**:
```
- **[Outcome]** - [Context/Evidence] ([Strategic link])
```

### Progress (3-5 items)

**Purpose**: Ongoing work that advanced but didn't complete.

**Guidance**:
- Focus on what moved forward
- Note milestone reached
- Include next milestone

**Format**:
```
- **[Initiative]**: [Progress made] → Next: [next milestone]
```

### Blockers/Risks (0-3 items)

**Purpose**: Issues that need attention or awareness.

**Guidance**:
- State the blocker clearly
- Include proposed resolution if you have one
- Note if you need help

**Format**:
```
- **[Blocker]**: [Description] → Proposed: [resolution] / Need: [help needed]
```

### Next Week Focus (3-5 items)

**Purpose**: Where attention goes next week.

**Guidance**:
- Specific, actionable items
- Prioritized by impact
- Realistic for the week

## Anti-Patterns

- **Activity focus** - "Attended meetings" without outcomes
- **Vague impact** - "Made good progress" without specifics
- **Underselling** - Hiding wins in passive voice
- **Missing metrics** - Where numbers are available, include them
