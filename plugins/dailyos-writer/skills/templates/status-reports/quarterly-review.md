# Quarterly Review Template

Comprehensive quarterly performance narrative combining achievements, strategic contribution, and forward outlook.

## When to Use

- Quarterly performance review preparation
- Self-assessment documentation
- Portfolio strategic review
- TAM Expectations contribution

## Core Principle

**Tell the story of your impact.**

A quarterly review isn't a list—it's a narrative that connects individual wins to strategic contribution. Help leadership understand not just what you did, but what it means.

## Structure

### Executive Summary (1 paragraph)

**Purpose**: The quarter in one breath for a busy reader.

**Guidance**:
- 3-4 sentences maximum
- Lead with biggest strategic outcome
- Include 1-2 key metrics
- Set up the narrative that follows

**Questions to ask**:
- Would someone understand my quarter from this alone?
- Am I leading with strategic contribution, not tasks?
- Is there a clear throughline?

### Strategic Contributions (3-4 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: The work that moved the needle on company priorities.

**Guidance**:
- Connect your work to company/team strategic goals
- Show how individual activities contributed to larger outcomes
- Be specific about your role vs. team effort
- Include quantified impact where possible

**Categories to consider**:
- Revenue impact (GRR, NRR, pipeline influenced)
- Customer outcomes (health, expansion, satisfaction)
- Cross-functional contribution (product feedback, market intelligence)
- Team/process improvement

**Questions to ask**:
- Is this connected to stated company priorities?
- Is my specific contribution clear?
- Would leadership see this as strategically significant?

### Key Wins (3-5 detailed examples)

**Purpose**: Specific accomplishments with context and impact.

**Guidance**:
- More detail than monthly highlights
- Include the challenge, your approach, and the outcome
- Show judgment and decision-making, not just execution
- Choose wins that demonstrate range

**Win anatomy**:
- **Situation**: What was the challenge or opportunity?
- **Action**: What did you specifically do?
- **Result**: What was the measurable outcome?
- **Significance**: Why does this matter?

**Questions to ask**:
- Do these wins demonstrate strategic thinking?
- Is my role clear and specific?
- Would these be compelling in a promotion discussion?

### Challenges & Learnings (1-2 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Honest reflection on difficulties and growth.

**Guidance**:
- Don't skip this—shows self-awareness
- Frame as learning, not excuses
- Be specific about what you'd do differently
- Show growth trajectory

**Questions to ask**:
- Am I being genuinely reflective?
- Is the learning specific and actionable?
- Does this show maturity, not just problems?

### Portfolio Health (1 paragraph + optional table)

**Purpose**: Snapshot of account portfolio status.

**Guidance**:
- High-level view of book of business
- Key metrics (ARR, health scores, risk)
- Notable changes from previous quarter
- Brief narrative around the numbers

**Questions to ask**:
- Is the overall health clear at a glance?
- Are changes explained?
- Would this satisfy a portfolio review question?

### Next Quarter Focus (1-2 paragraphs)

**Purpose**: Forward-looking priorities and goals.

**Guidance**:
- 2-3 key priorities
- How they connect to strategic goals
- What success looks like
- Any resources or support needed

**Questions to ask**:
- Are my priorities clear and specific?
- Do they align with company direction?
- Am I setting appropriate expectations?

## Anti-Patterns

- **Activity dump** - Lists of meetings and tasks
- **Underselling** - Passive voice hiding your contribution
- **All wins, no reflection** - Lacks credibility
- **Generic goals** - "Continue doing good work"
- **Missing metrics** - No quantified impact
- **No strategic connection** - Wins without significance

## Example

See `Leadership/02-Performance/Quarterly-Reviews/` for full examples of completed quarterly reviews.

Key patterns from strong reviews:

- Quantify impact where possible (revenue, metrics, count)
- Show judgment and decision-making in win narratives
- Be honest about challenges without making excuses
- Forward priorities should feel ambitious but achievable
