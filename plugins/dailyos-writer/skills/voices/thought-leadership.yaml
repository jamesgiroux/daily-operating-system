  context: "Practitioners who want actionable insights, not lectures"

voice:
  tone: "Conversational with strategic depth"
  style: "HBR for account management - authoritative but accessible"

    - Name the problem clearly and sit in it
    - Provide genuinely counterintuitive insights

    - Land with a memorable close
    - Use personal stories as proof points

  avoid:
    - Rushing to the solution

  - "Is the reframe genuinely counterintuitive?"
  - "Are there natural conversational asides?"
  - "Does the practice section give concrete actions?"
  - "Would this feel at home in HBR?"
  - "Would a TAM share this with their manager?"
  - "Can the reader do something different tomorrow?"
