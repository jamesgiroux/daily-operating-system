# Narrative Voice Profile
# For: Video scripts, documentary content, explainers, thought leadership videos

name: "Narrative"
content_types:
  - video-script
  - documentary
  - explainer
  - podcast-outline

audience:
  primary: "Enterprise decision-makers, external viewers"
  secondary: "Industry peers, potential customers"
  context: "Viewers who want insight through story, not slides"

voice:
  tone: "Direct address, honest acknowledgment of complexity"
  style: "Documentary storytelling - Trudeau communication approach"
  authority: "Earned through argument, not asserted"

  pronouns:
    primary: "we"  # Shared journey with viewer
    when_appropriate: "you"  # Direct address for emphasis

  principles:
    - "Show through specific stories, don't announce emotions"
    - "Resolution is earned, not announced"
    - "Explain the system before critiquing it"
    - "Let tension breathe before resolution"
    - "Connect new concepts to established context"

  do:
    - Use "we" to create shared journey
    - Show the problem through concrete examples
    - Explain mechanics before offering critique
    - Let the argument earn the positioning
    - Use specific stories as evidence
    - Create natural transitions between ideas

  avoid:
    - Telling instead of showing ("This was frustrating" vs. showing frustration)
    - Unearned resolution (positioning that doesn't flow from argument)
    - Rushing mechanics (critique before explanation)
    - Signposting ("In this video, we'll cover...")
    - Announcing emotions ("This is exciting because...")

structure:
  default_template: "documentary-arc"

  principles:
    - "Problem-solution arc with earned resolution"
    - "Let tension breathe before resolution"
    - "VIP positioning emerges naturally from argument"
    - "Each section advances the story"

  arc_structure:
    setup:
      purpose: "Establish the world and the problem"
      guidance: "Show, don't tell. Use specific examples."

    tension:
      purpose: "Develop the complexity"
      guidance: "Let it breathe. Don't rush to resolution."

    turn:
      purpose: "The insight or shift"
      guidance: "This should feel earned by the preceding argument."

    resolution:
      purpose: "What this means, what's possible"
      guidance: "Positioning flows naturally, not inserted."

  formats:
    - documentary-arc: "Problem → Tension → Turn → Resolution"
    - explainer: "Teaching a concept through story"
    - future-vision: "What the world looks like if we succeed"

quality_checks:
  - "Are we showing through stories, not telling?"
  - "Is the resolution earned through argument?"
  - "Did we explain mechanics before critiquing?"
  - "Does positioning emerge naturally?"
  - "Would this work as a spoken piece?"
  - "Does it create a shared journey with 'we'?"

pacing_guidance:
  # Video-specific considerations
  attention:
    - "Hook in first 10 seconds"
    - "New idea or example every 30-60 seconds"
    - "Tension peaks before resolution"

  rhythm:
    - "Vary sentence length for spoken delivery"
    - "Short sentences for emphasis"
    - "Longer sentences for exploration"
    - "Pause moments (implied in script)"

example_phrases:
  good:
    - "We've all been in that meeting where..."
    - "Here's what that actually looks like..."
    - "And this is where it gets interesting."

  avoid:
    - "In this video, we're going to discuss..."
    - "This is really exciting because..."
    - "As you can clearly see..."
