# Distribution & Repurposing Guide

Guidance for adapting content across channels, formats, and audiences—including sanitizing internal content for external distribution.

---

## Format Selection Matrix

| Primary Channel | Word Count | Format | Urgency | Depth |
|-----------------|-----------|--------|---------|-------|
| **P2 (internal)** | 800-1500 | Markdown, headers, bullets | Low | High |
| **Slack update** | 50-150 | Plain text, emoji sparingly | High | Low |
| **Executive email** | 200-400 | Short paragraphs, bold conclusions | High | Medium |
| **LinkedIn post** | 150-300 | Hook-driven, line breaks | Medium | Low |
| **Personal blog** | 1200-2500 | Narrative flow, personality | Low | High |
| **Newsletter excerpt** | 200-400 | Teaser with value | Medium | Medium |

---

## Channel Characteristics

### Slack

**Format constraints**:
- 150 words max (most will skim)
- Lead with the takeaway
- One key point, not three
- No markdown headers (use **bold** and line breaks)
- Emoji for visual breaks, not decoration

**Structure**:
```
[One-line summary/hook]

[2-3 sentences of context or detail]

[Next step or link if needed]
```

**Example transformation** (P2 → Slack):
```
P2 Version (800 words):
"Cox Automotive approved the Agentforce pilot expansion yesterday.
This represents our first formal commitment beyond POC scope..."

Slack Version (50 words):
🎯 Cox approved Agentforce pilot expansion

50 dealers, February launch. This is our first formal commitment
beyond POC and validates the co-sell model we've been building.

Next step: Dealer selection finalized by Jan 17.
```

### LinkedIn

**Format constraints**:
- 150-300 words (engagement drops after)
- Hook in first line (visible before "see more")
- Line breaks between paragraphs
- Personal perspective, not corporate voice
- Question or call-to-action at end

**Structure**:
```
[Hook - the scroll-stopping line]

[Context - why this matters]

[Insight - what you learned/observed]

[Takeaway - what others can do with this]

[Question or engagement prompt]
```

**What to sanitize**:
- Customer names → "enterprise customer" or industry
- Specific revenue → ranges or "significant"
- Internal project names → generic descriptions
- Proprietary strategies → general patterns

**Example transformation** (Internal insight → LinkedIn):
```
Internal:
"Cox's Agentforce pilot showed 60% reduction in dealer inquiry
response time. This validates our thesis that AI-powered
customer support on CMS platforms is a differentiator."

LinkedIn:
Most enterprise content platforms treat AI as a feature list.
We just proved it's actually a support model.

Working with an automotive customer, we tested AI-powered
responses for their dealer network. The result: 60% faster
response times without adding headcount.

The insight? AI on content platforms isn't about generation.
It's about making the content you already have more useful.

What AI use cases are you seeing that surprised you?
```

### Personal Blog

**Format characteristics**:
- 1200-2500 words (depth expected)
- More personal voice than P2
- Can include opinion and speculation
- Readers opt in (lower urgency)
- SEO matters if public

**What to keep from internal**:
- Core insights and frameworks
- General patterns and observations
- Personal stories (with discretion)
- Industry analysis

**What to remove**:
- Customer-identifying details
- Internal metrics and ARR
- Competitive positioning specifics
- Confidential strategies

**What to add**:
- More personal context
- Broader industry framing
- External examples and references
- Calls to action (comments, newsletter, etc.)

---

### Executive Email

**Format constraints**:
- 200-400 words max
- BLUF mandatory (conclusion in first sentence)
- One ask per email
- Mobile-readable (short paragraphs)
- Bold the key information

**Structure**:
```
Subject: [Action needed]: [Topic]

[First sentence: The ask or key point]

[2-3 short paragraphs: Context and support]

[Clear next step with timeline]
```

---

## Repurposing Workflows

### Internal → External (Sanitization)

Content created for P2s, internal updates, or customer-specific docs can often be repurposed for broader distribution with proper sanitization.

**Step 1: Content audit**
- [ ] What's confidential? (customer names, revenue, strategy)
- [ ] What's proprietary? (competitive positioning, pricing)
- [ ] What's generalizable? (patterns, frameworks, insights)

**Step 2: Generalize specifics**

| Internal | External |
|----------|----------|
| "Cox Automotive" | "A Fortune 500 automotive company" |
| "$400K deal" | "Six-figure partnership" |
| "Summit ring customer" | "Strategic account" |
| "Our Agentforce connector" | "AI integration capabilities" |
| "Beating Contentful" | "Competing effectively in enterprise evaluations" |

**Step 3: Reframe perspective**

Internal content often assumes shared context. External content needs:
- Industry framing (why this matters broadly)
- Personal angle (your perspective, not company position)
- Teaching orientation (what others can learn)

**Step 4: Channel adaptation**

Apply format guidelines for target channel.

### Long → Short (Compression)

For repurposing long-form content into shorter formats.

**Compression levels**:

| From | To | Keep |
|------|----|----- |
| 1500-word P2 | 300-word LinkedIn | One insight + one example |
| 1500-word P2 | 100-word Slack | The headline + the "so what" |
| 1500-word P2 | 400-word email | BLUF + key evidence + ask |

**Compression technique**:
1. State the main insight in one sentence
2. Find the single best supporting evidence
3. Cut everything else
4. Add appropriate framing for channel

---

### Series → Synthesis

Multiple related pieces can be synthesized into new formats.

**Example**: Weekly impact captures → Monthly summary → Quarterly narrative

**Synthesis technique**:
1. Identify themes across pieces
2. Extract the "so what" pattern
3. Find the story that connects them
4. Write fresh synthesis (not just compilation)

---

## Sanitization Checklist

Before publishing externally, verify:

**Customer confidentiality**:
- [ ] No customer names without approval
- [ ] No specific revenue figures
- [ ] No internal project names
- [ ] No stakeholder names

**Competitive sensitivity**:
- [ ] No specific competitor disparagement
- [ ] No win/loss details that identify accounts
- [ ] No pricing or commercial terms
- [ ] No unpublished product roadmap

**Strategic sensitivity**:
- [ ] No internal strategy documents referenced
- [ ] No confidential market positioning
- [ ] No leadership planning details
- [ ] Nothing you wouldn't want a customer to see

**Personal appropriateness**:
- [ ] Would you be comfortable if your manager saw this?
- [ ] Would you be comfortable if a customer saw this?
- [ ] Does this represent your views appropriately?

## Secondary Application Planning

When creating content, consider upfront:

**Primary purpose**: What is this content for originally?
**Secondary potential**: Where else could this be valuable?
**Sanitization needed**: What would need to change?
**Additional work**: How much adaptation required?

**Example planning**:
```
Primary: P2 post on Foundation ring management philosophy
Secondary potential:
- LinkedIn post (needs generalization, remove VIP-specific terms)
- Blog post (needs expansion, industry framing)
- Slack summary (needs compression to key insight)

Sanitization: Remove lifecycle ring terminology, generalize
"Foundation accounts" to "smaller accounts in your portfolio"

Additional work: LinkedIn = 30 min, Blog = 2 hours
```

---

## Voice Adaptation

Different channels require different voice calibration:

| Channel | Formality | Personality | Opinion |
|---------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Internal P2 | Medium | Medium | Open |
| Executive email | High | Low | Cautious |
| Slack | Low | High | Casual |
| LinkedIn | Medium | High | Personal takes OK |
| Personal blog | Low-Medium | High | Expected |
| Customer comms | High | Medium | Diplomatic |

**Voice shift examples**:

P2 (medium formality):
> "The Foundation ring accounts need a different operating model than our natural instincts suggest."

LinkedIn (personal):
> "Here's something counterintuitive I've learned: your smallest customers might need the most intentional approach."

Blog (personality):
> "I spent two years doing Foundation accounts wrong. Not wrong in a dramatic way—wrong in the slow, invisible way that compounds until you notice the pattern."

---

## Quick Reference

**For Slack summary of anything**:
1. What's the one headline?
2. Why should they care? (one sentence)
3. What happens next? (if applicable)

**For LinkedIn from internal content**:
1. Extract one transferable insight
2. Remove all identifying details
3. Add personal perspective
4. End with question

**For blog from P2**:
1. Expand context for external audience
2. Add industry framing
3. Include more personality/opinion
4. Remove confidential specifics
5. Add external examples if helpful
