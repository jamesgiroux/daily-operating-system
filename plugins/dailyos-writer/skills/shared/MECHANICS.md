# Grammar & Mechanics

Universal rules that apply to all content types.

## Typography Rules

### Em Dashes (Don't Use Them)

**Rule**: Replace em dashes with parentheses, periods, or sentence restructuring.

**Why**: Em dashes create visual clutter and often signal sentences that should be split or restructured.

**Examples**:

| With em dashes | Better |
|---------------|--------|
| "Two Salesforce AEs—Keith Coles and Joe Shunia—reached out" | "Two Salesforce AEs (Keith Coles from Data Cloud and Joe Shunia from Marketing Cloud Digital) reached out" |
| "Dreamforce wasn't the finish line—it was the starting point" | "Dreamforce was the starting point." |
| "The momentum is real—it's commercial, and moving fast" | "The momentum is translating into commercial activity." |

### Quotation Marks

**Use curly quotes**, not straight quotes:
- Correct: "WordPress VIP"
- Wrong: "WordPress VIP"

**Exception**: Code snippets and technical documentation use straight quotes.

### Ellipses

**Format**: Three periods with spaces
- Correct: word . . . word
- Wrong: word...word

### Oxford Comma

**Always use the serial comma**:
- Correct: "visibility, outcomes, and market validation"
- Wrong: "visibility, outcomes and validation"

## Sentence Structure

### Active Voice Preference

**Prefer active voice** for clarity and directness:
- Good: "Salesforce AEs brought us into the deal"
- Acceptable: "We were brought into the deal by Salesforce AEs"

**Exception**: Use passive when the actor is unknown or irrelevant.

### Paragraph Length

**Target**: 2-4 sentences per paragraph for P2 posts

**Why**: Scannable for busy executives reading on mobile

### Heading Hierarchy

**Follow consistent structure**:
```
# Document Title (H1 - once per document)
## Major Sections (H2)
### Subsections (H3)
```

Never skip heading levels (don't go H1 to H3).

## Lists

### Bulleted Lists

**Introduce with a colon when the intro is a complete sentence**:

Good:
```
The focus shifts to:
- Executing on NXP
- Formalizing partnerships
- Building field enablement
```

**No colon when the intro is a sentence fragment**:

Good:
```
We're focusing on
- Executing on NXP
- Formalizing partnerships
```

### Parallel Structure

**Keep list items grammatically parallel**:

Good:
```
- Execute on NXP pursuit
- Formalize partnership agreements
- Build field enablement
```

Wrong (not parallel):
```
- Execute on NXP pursuit
- Partnership agreements should be formalized
- Building field enablement
```

## Common Errors

### It's vs. Its

- **It's** = It is (contraction)
- **Its** = Possessive

### That vs. Which

- **That** = Restrictive clause (no comma)
  - "The connector that syncs WordPress content to Data Cloud"
- **Which** = Non-restrictive clause (with comma)
  - "The connector, which launched in October, is now GA"

### Affect vs. Effect

- **Affect** = Verb (to influence)
  - "This will affect our Q4 pipeline"
- **Effect** = Noun (the result)
  - "The effect was immediate commercial traction"

**Exception**: "Effect" can be a verb meaning "to bring about"
- "We effected change through partnership"
